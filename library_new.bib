abstract = {With the rapid growth of optical-based neuroimaging to explore human brain functioning, our research group has been developing broadband Near Infrared Spectroscopy (bNIRS) instruments, a technological extension to functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). bNIRS has the unique capacity of monitoring brain haemodynamics/oxygenation (measuring oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin), and metabolism (measuring the changes in the redox state of cytochrome-c-oxidase). When combined with electroencephalography (EEG), bNIRS provides a unique neuromonitoring platform to explore neurovascular coupling mechanisms. In this paper, we present a novel pipeline for the integrated analysis of bNIRS and EEG signals, and demonstrate its use on multi-channel bNIRS data recorded with concurrent EEG on healthy adults during a visual stimulation task. We introduce the use of the Finite Impulse Response functions within the General Linear Model for bNIRS and show its feasibility to statistically localize the haemodynamic and metabolic activity in the occipital cortex. Moreover, our results suggest that the fusion of haemodynamic and metabolic measures unveils additional information on brain functioning over haemodynamic imaging alone. The cross-correlation-based analysis of interrelationships between electrical (EEG) and haemodynamic/metabolic (bNIRS) activity revealed that the bNIRS metabolic signal offers a unique marker of brain activity, being more closely coupled to the neuronal EEG response.},

abstract = {The role of hypoperfusion in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a vital component to understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. Disrupted perfusion is not only evident throughout disease manifestation, it is also demonstrated during the pre-clinical phase of AD (i.e., mild cognitive impairment) as well as in cognitively healthy persons at high-risk for developing AD due to family history or genetic factors. Studies have used a variety of imaging modalities (e.g., SPECT, MRI, PET) to investigate AD, but with its recent technological advancements and non-invasive use of blood water as an endogenous tracer, arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI has become an imaging technique of growing popularity. Through numerous ASL studies, it is now known that AD is associated with both global and regional cerebral hypoperfusion and that there is considerable overlap between the regions implicated in the disease state (consistently reported in precuneus/posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortex) and those implicated in disease risk. Debate exists as to whether decreased blood flow in AD is a cause or consequence of the disease. Nonetheless, hypoperfusion in AD is associated with both structural and functional changes in the brain and offers a promising putative biomarker that could potentially identify AD in its pre-clinical state and be used to explore treatments to prevent, or at least slow, the progression of the disease. Finally, given that perfusion is a vascular phenomenon, we provide insights from a vascular lesion model (i.e., stroke) and illustrate the influence of disrupted perfusion on brain structure and function and, ultimately, cognition in AD. {\textcopyright} 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract = {Background: Midlife hypertension confers increased risk for cognitive impairment in late life. The sensitive period for risk exposure and extent that risk is mediated through amyloid or vascular-related mechanisms are poorly understood. We aimed to identify if, and when, blood pressure or change in blood pressure during adulthood were associated with late-life brain structure, pathology, and cognition. Methods: Participants were from Insight 46, a neuroscience substudy of the ongoing longitudinal Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, a birth cohort that initially comprised 5362 individuals born throughout mainland Britain in one week in 1946. Participants aged 69–71 years received T1 and FLAIR volumetric MRI, florbetapir amyloid-PET imaging, and cognitive assessment at University College London (London, UK); all participants were dementia-free. Blood pressure measurements had been collected at ages 36, 43, 53, 60–64, and 69 years. We also calculated blood pressure change variables between ages. Primary outcome measures were white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) quantified from multimodal MRI using an automated method, amyloid-$\beta$ positivity or negativity using a standardised uptake value ratio approach, whole-brain and hippocampal volumes quantified from 3D-T1 MRI, and a composite cognitive score—the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC). We investigated associations between blood pressure and blood pressure changes at and between 36, 43, 53, 60–64, and 69 years of age with WMHV using generalised linear models with a gamma distribution and log link function, amyloid-$\beta$ status using logistic regression, whole-brain volume and hippocampal volumes using linear regression, and PACC score using linear regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. Findings: Between May 28, 2015, and Jan 10, 2018, 502 individuals were assessed as part of Insight 46. 465 participants (238 [51{\%}] men; mean age 70{\textperiodcentered}7 years [SD 0{\textperiodcentered}7]; 83 [18{\%}] amyloid-$\beta$-positive) were included in imaging analyses. Higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at age 53 years and greater increases in SBP and DBP between 43 and 53 years were positively associated with WMHV at 69–71 years of age (increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater SBP 7{\%}, 95{\%} CI 1–14, p=0{\textperiodcentered}024; increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater DBP 15{\%}, 4–27, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0057; increase in mean WMHV per one SD change in SBP 15{\%}, 3–29, p=0{\textperiodcentered}012; increase in mean WMHV per 1 SD change in DBP 15{\%}, 3–30, p=0{\textperiodcentered}017). Higher DBP at 43 years of age was associated with smaller whole-brain volume at 69–71 years of age (−6{\textperiodcentered}9 mL per 10 mm Hg greater DBP, −11{\textperiodcentered}9 to −1{\textperiodcentered}9, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0068), as were greater increases in DBP between 36 and 43 years of age (−6{\textperiodcentered}5 mL per 1 SD change, −11{\textperiodcentered}1 to −1{\textperiodcentered}9, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0054). Greater increases in SBP between 36 and 43 years of age were associated with smaller hippocampal volumes at 69–71 years of age (−0{\textperiodcentered}03 mL per 1 SD change, −0{\textperiodcentered}06 to −0{\textperiodcentered}001, p=0{\textperiodcentered}043). Neither absolute blood pressure nor change in blood pressure predicted amyloid-$\beta$ status or PACC score at 69–71 years of age. Interpretation: High and increasing blood pressure from early adulthood into midlife seems to be associated with increased WMHV and smaller brain volumes at 69–71 years of age. We found no evidence that blood pressure affected cognition or cerebral amyloid-$\beta$ load at this age. Blood pressure monitoring and interventions might need to start around 40 years of age to maximise late-life brain health.

abstract = {The application of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in the neurosciences has been expanding over the last 40 years. Today, it is addressing a wide range of applications within different populations and utilizes a great variety of experimental paradigms. With the rapid growth and the diversification of research methods, some inconsistencies are appearing in the way in which methods are presented, which can make the interpretation and replication of studies unnecessarily challenging. The Society for Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy has thus been motivated to organize a representative (but not exhaustive) group of leaders in the field to build a consensus on the best practices for describing the methods utilized in fNIRS studies. Our paper has been designed to provide guidelines to help enhance the reliability, repeatability, and traceability of reported fNIRS studies and encourage best practices throughout the community. A checklist is provided to guide authors in the preparation of their manuscripts and to assist reviewers when evaluating fNIRS papers.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive neuroimaging tool for studying evoked hemodynamic changes within the brain. By this technique, changes in the optical absorption of light are recorded over time and are used to estimate the functionally evoked changes in cerebral oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhe-moglobin concentrations that result from local cerebral vascular and oxygen metabolic effects during brain activity. Over the past three decades this technology has continued to grow, and today NIRS studies have found many niche applications in the fields of psychology, physiology, and cerebral pathology. The growing popularity of this technique is in part associated with a lower cost and increased portability of NIRS equipment when compared with other imaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. With this increasing number of applications, new techniques for the processing, analysis, and interpretation of NIRS data are continually being developed. We review some of the time-series and functional analysis techniques that are currently used in NIRS studies, we describe the practical implementation of various signal processing techniques for removing physiological, instrumental, and motion-artifact noise from optical data, and we discuss the unique aspects of NIRS analysis in comparison with other brain imaging modalities. These methods are described within the context of the MATLAB-based graphical user interface program, HomER, which we have developed and distributed to facilitate the processing of optical functional brain data. {\textcopyright} 2009 Optical Society of America {\textcopyright} 2009 Optical Society of America.},

abstract = {Systemic physiology and motion-induced artifacts represent two major sources of confounding noise in functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) imaging that can reduce the performance of analyses and inflate false positive rates (i.e., type I errors) of detecting evoked hemodynamic responses. In this work, we demonstrated a general algorithm for solving the general linear model (GLM) for both deconvolution (finite impulse response) and canonical regression models based on designing optimal pre-whitening filters using autoregressive models and employing iteratively reweighted least squares. We evaluated the performance of the new method by performing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses using synthetic data, in which serial correlations, motion artifacts, and evoked responses were controlled via simulations, as well as using experimental data from children (3-5 years old) as a source baseline physiological noise and motion artifacts. The new method outperformed ordinary least squares (OLS) with no motion correction, wavelet based motion correction, or spline interpolation based motion correction in the presence of physiological and motion related noise. In the experimental data, false positive rates were as high as 37{\%} when the estimated p-value was 0.05 for the OLS methods. The false positive rate was reduced to 5-9{\%} with the proposed method. Overall, the method improves control of type I errors and increases performance when motion artifacts are present. {\textcopyright} 2013 Optical Society of America.},

abstract = {Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of most myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic strokes. B-mode ultrasound of carotid arteries provides measures of intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaques, both widely used as surrogate measures of cardiovascular disease. Although IMT and plaques are highly intercorrelated, IMT's role as a marker of atherosclerosis has been questioned, especially when measurements include the common carotid artery (CCA) only. Plaque and intima-media thickening may reflect different biological aspects of atherogenesis with distinctive relations to clinical vascular disease. Plaque measured in the carotid bulb or internal carotid artery is stronger related to hyperlipidemia and smoking and is a stronger predictor for MI, whereas CCA-IMT is stronger related to hypertension and ischemic stroke. Echolucent plaque morphology (ie, lipid-rich plaques) seems to increase the risk for MI and stroke. New evidence suggests that total plaque area is the most strongly predictive of cardiovascular risk of the ultrasound phenotypes. {\textcopyright} 2009 by Current Medicine Group LLC.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether memory performance in hypertensive subjects induces diminished parietal and prefrontal blood flow activation relative to normotensive subjects but compensatory amygdala/hippocampal activation. Methods: Thirty-seven untreated hypertensive subjects and 59 normotensive control subjects performed in two memory and one sensorimotor task while global and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was assessed with [15O]water and PET. Neuropsychological, carotid artery ultrasound, and MRI assessments were obtained. Results: When they were engaged in memory tasks, increases of CBF in hypertensive subjects were less than in normotensive subjects in the posterior parietal area, as expected; blunted responses were also shown within the middle posterior arterial watershed and thalamus. Relative to all other participants, hypertensive subjects that performed relatively well on verbal memory showed an enhanced rCBF response in the right amygdala/hippocampus. Furthermore, hypertensive, but not normotensive, subjects showed task-induced rCBF in the amygdala/hippocampal area that was significantly correlated with task-induced prefrontal rCBF. No confounding influences were identified from carotid artery or MRI measures. Conclusions: Memory performance in hypertensive individuals is related to a blunted regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) response, particularly in parietal cortex. Potentially compensatory rCBF responses appear to occur in midbrain and correlate with prefrontal rCBF. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.},

The wavelet transform is a relatively new concept (about 10 years old), but yet there are quite a few articles and books written on them. However, most of these books and articles are written by math people, for the other math people; still most of the math people don't know what the other math people are 1 talking about (a math professor of mine made this confession). In other words, majority of the literature available on wavelet transforms are of little help, if any, to those who are new to this subject (this is my personal opinion). When I first started working on wavelet transforms I have struggled for many hours and days to figure out what was going on in this mysterious world of wavelet transforms, due to the lack of introductory level text(s) in this subject. Therefore, I have decided to write this tutorial for the ones who are new to the topic. I consider myself quite new to the subject too, and I have to confess that I have not figured out all the theoretical details yet. However, as far as the engineering applications are concerned, I think all the theoretical details are not necessarily necessary (!). In this tutorial I will try to give basic principles underlying the wavelet theory. The proofs of the theorems and related equations will not be given in this tutorial due to the simple assumption that the intended readers of this tutorial do not need them at this time. However, interested readers will be directed to related references for further and in-depth information.},

Results confirmed AD patients' difficulty in suppressing the automatic response of reading in the Interference Stroop task.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Arterial stiffening and thickening and endothelial dysfunction may be associated with cognitive decline or white matter hyperintensities (WMH) independently of blood pressure level. We aimed to investigate, using an integrative approach, the relative contributions of structural and functional vascular factors to the degree of cognitive impairment (primary outcome) and the severity of WMH (secondary outcome) in elderly hypertensive patients with subjective memory complaints, a group prone to dementia. METHODS: A prospective, dedicated, cross-sectional population of 198 elderly hypertensive patients (mean age 69.3+/-6.2 years) with subjective memory complaints underwent a full set of cognitive function assessments, brain MRI with semiquantification of WMH, carotid ultrasonography, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, brachial endothelial function, and plasma von Willebrand Factor measurements. RESULTS: After adjustment for the usual cardiovascular risk factors, increased arterial stiffness (as assessed by pulse wave velocity) was significantly and independently associated with memory impairment in men. The severity of WMH was independently associated with increased carotid intima media thickness and stiffness (as assessed by augmentation index) as well as with increased age and plasma levels of von Willebrand Factor, a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that vascular abnormalities, independently of blood pressure levels, may play a role in the setting of subjective memory complaints as well as of WMH in elderly hypertensive patients. Arterial thickness and stiffness as well as endothelial function should be assessed simultaneously and may represent additional targets for the prevention of subjective memory complaints and WMH.},

Methods: By means of NIRS and TCD, noninvasive and inexpensive technologies, we studied 21 patients with aMCI (10 M and 11 F, 70.2 ± 7.3. years) and 10 age matched healthy controls. Results: By means of NIRS, we found a significant mean decrease of tissue oxygen saturation of cortex microcirculation (TOI), - 27{\%}, p{\textless} 0.0005, on the temporal-parietal cortex of both side compared to the controls.

abstract = {The affective state of an animal, which is thought to reflect its welfare, consists of both short-term emotional reactions and long-term general mood. Because this state is generated and processed by the brain, we used non-invasive measurement of such brain activity as a novel indicator variable and investigated the interplay of mood and short-term emotional reactions in animals. We developed a wireless sensor for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which assesses cortical perfusion changes, and consequently neuronal activity. Mood differences were induced by barren and enriched housing in a total of nine sheep and we observed their brain reaction in response to the positive situation of being groomed. We detected a decrease in cerebral oxyhaemoglobin concentration ([O2Hb]) which persisted during grooming. The localisation of the decrease in the brain did not depend on the site where the stimulus was applied. Also, the intensity of the response did not depend on the intensity of the grooming stimulus and a sham stimulus did not evoke an [O2Hb] response as seen with a grooming stimulus. Thus, we conclude that the observed haemodynamic brain response was unlikely to reflect pure somato-sensory information. We then found that the amplitude of the [O2Hb] response was larger if sheep were in a supposedly more negative mood. This contradicts the common assumption that negative mood generally taints reactions to emotional stimuli. Our results also demonstrate the potential of fNIRS for assessing affective states in freely moving animals. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an increasingly popular technology for studying brain function. NIRS presents several advantages relative to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), such as measurement of concentration changes in both oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, finer temporal resolution, and ease of administration, as well as disadvantages, most prominently inferior spatial resolution and decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While fMRI has become the gold standard for in vivo imaging of the human brain, in practice NIRS is a more convenient and less expensive technology than fMRI. It is therefore of interest to many researchers how NIRS compares to fMRI in studies of brain function. In the present study we scanned participants with simultaneous NIRS and fMRI on a battery of cognitive tasks, placing NIRS probes over both frontal and parietal brain regions. We performed detailed comparisons of the signals in both temporal and spatial domains. We found that NIRS signals have significantly weaker SNR, but are nonetheless often highly correlated with fMRI measurements. Both SNR and the distance between the scalp and the brain contributed to variability in the NIRS/fMRI correlations. In the spatial domain, we found that a photon path forming an ellipse between the NIRS emitter and detector correlated most strongly with the BOLD response. Taken together these findings suggest that, while NIRS can be an appropriate substitute for fMRI for studying brain activity related to cognitive tasks, care should be taken when designing studies with NIRS to ensure that: 1) the spatial resolution is adequate for answering the question of interest and 2) the design accounts for weaker SNR, especially in brain regions more distal from the scalp. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis is an important tool for interpreting results of functional neuroimaging studies and is highly influential in predicting and testing new outcomes. Although traditional label-based review can be used to search for agreement across multiple studies, a new function-location meta-analysis technique called activation likelihood estimation (ALE) offers great improvements over conventional methods. In ALE, reported foci are modeled as Gaussian functions and pooled to create a statistical whole-brain image. ALE meta-analysis and the label-based review were used to investigate the Stroop task in normal subjects, a paradigm known for its effect of producing conflict and response inhibition due to subjects' tendency to perform word reading as opposed to color naming. Both methods yielded similar activation patterns that were dominated by response in the anterior cingulate and the inferior frontal gyrus. ALE showed greater involvement of the anterior cingulate as compared to that in the label-based technique; however, this was likely due to the increased spatial level of distinction allowed with the ALE method. With ALE, further analysis of the anterior cingulate revealed evidence for somatotopic mapping within the rostral and caudal cingulate zones, an issue that has been the source of some conflict in previous reviews of the anterior cingulate cortex. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Brain activity can be monitored non-invasively by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which has several advantages in comparison with other imaging methods, such as flexibility, portability, low cost and biochemical specificity. Moreover, patients and children can be repetitively examined. Therefore, the objective of the study was to test the feasibility of NIRS for the event-related approach in functional brain activation studies with cognitive paradigms. Thus, changes in the concentration of oxy-, deoxy-, and total hemoglobin were measured by NIRS in 14 healthy subjects while performing a color-word matching Stroop task in an event-related design. The hemodynamic response (increase in the concentration of oxy-/total hemoglobin and decrease in the concentration of deoxy-hemoglobin) was stronger during incongruent compared to congruent and neutral trials of the Stroop task in the lateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally. This stronger hemodynamic response was interpreted as a stronger brain activation during incongruent trials of the Stroop task, due to interference. A new method for NIRS data evaluation that enables the analysis of the hemodynamic response to each single trial is introduced. Each hemodynamic response was characterized by the parameters gain, lag and dispersion of a Gaussian function fitted by nonlinear regression. Specific differences between the incongruent and neutral condition were found for gain and lag. Further, these parameters were correlated with the behavioral performance. In conclusion, brain activity may be studied by NIRS using cognitive stimuli in an event-related design. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss; Inc.},

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: Perturbations in cerebral blood volume (CBV), blood flow (CBF), and metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) lead to associated changes in tissue concentrations of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin ($\delta$O and $\delta$D), which can be measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A novel hemodynamic model has been introduced to relate physiological perturbations and measured quantities. We seek to use this model to determine functional traces of cbv(t) and cbf(t) - cmro2(t) from time-varying NIRS data, and cerebrovascular physiological parameters from oscillatory NIRS data (lowercase letters denote the relative changes in CBV, CBF, and CMRO2 with respect to baseline). Such a practical implementation of a quantitative hemodynamic model is an important step toward the clinical translation of NIRS. Materials and Methods: In the time domain, we have simulated O(t) and D(t) traces induced by cerebral activation. In the frequency domain, we have performed a new analysis of frequency-resolved measurements of cerebral hemodynamic oscillations during a paced breathing paradigm. Results: We have demonstrated that cbv(t) and cbf(t) - cmro2(t) can be reliably obtained from O(t) and D(t) using the model, and that the functional NIRS signals are delayed with respect to cbf(t) - cmro2(t) as a result of the blood transit time in the microvasculature. In the frequency domain, we have identified physiological parameters (e.g., blood transit time, cutoff frequency of autoregulation) that can be measured by frequency-resolved measurements of hemodynamic oscillations. Conclusions: The ability to perform noninvasive measurements of cerebrovascular parameters has far-reaching clinical implications. Functional brain studies rely on measurements of CBV, CBF, and CMRO2, whereas the diagnosis and assessment of neurovascular disorders, traumatic brain injury, and stroke would benefit from measurements of local cerebral hemodynamics and autoregulation. {\textcopyright} 2014 AUR.},

abstract = {Components of the Stroop task were examined to investigate the role that inhibitory processes play in cognitive changes in healthy older adults and in individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Inhibitory breakdowns should result in an increase in Stroop interference. The results indicate that older adults show a disproportionate increase in interference compared with younger adults. DAT individuals show interference proportionate to older adults but a disproportionate increase in facilitation for congruent color-word trials, and an increased intrusion of word naming on incongruent color naming trials. An exGaussian analysis of response time distributions indicated that the increased interference observed in older adults was due to an increase in the tail of the distribution. Application of the process dissociation analysis of the Stroop task (D. S. Lindsay {\&} L. L. Jacoby, 1994) indicated that older adults showed increased word process estimates, whereas DAT individuals showed differences in both color and word process estimates. Taken together, the results are consistent with an inhibitory breakdown in normal aging and an accelerated breakdown in inhibition in DAT individuals.},

Methods: We evaluated APOE-related differences in BOLD activation in response to a memory task, cerebrovascular reactivity using a CO2-inhalation challenge (CO2-CVR), and the potential contribution of CO2-CVR to the BOLD signal. Results: APOE $\epsilon$4-carriers had the highest task-related hippocampal BOLD signal relative to non-carriers. The largest differences in CO2-CVR were between $\epsilon$2- and $\epsilon$4-carriers, with the latter having the lowest values. Genotype differences in CO2-CVR accounted for ∼70{\%} of hippocampal BOLD differences between groups. Conclusion: Because CO2-CVR gauges vascular health, the differential effect of APOE in young adults may reflect a vascular contribution to the vulnerability of $\epsilon$4-carriers to late-life pathology. Studies confirming our findings are warranted.},

abstract = {According to prominent theories of aging, the brain may reorganize to compensate for neural deterioration and prevent or offset cognitive decline. A frequent and striking finding in functional imaging studies is that older adults recruit additional regions relative to young adults performing the same task. This is often interpreted as evidence for functional reorganization, suggesting that, as people age, different regions or networks may support the same cognitive functions. Associations between additional recruitment and better performance in older adults have led to the suggestion that the additional recruitment may contribute to preserved cognitive function in old age and may explain some of the variation among individuals in preservation of function. However, many alternative explanations are possible, and recent findings and methodological developments have highlighted the need for more systematic approaches to determine whether reorganization occurs with age and whether it benefits performance. We reevaluate current evidence for compensatory functional reorganization in the light of recent moves to address these challenges.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Motion artifact contamination in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data has become an important challenge in realizing the full potential of NIRS for real-life applications. Various motion correction algorithms have been used to alleviate the effect of motion artifacts on the estimation of the hemodynamic response function. While smoothing methods, such as wavelet filtering, are excellent in removing motion-induced sharp spikes, the baseline shifts in the signal remain after this type of filtering. Methods, such as spline interpolation, on the other hand, can properly correct baseline shifts; however, they leave residual high-frequency spikes. We propose a hybrid method that takes advantage of different correction algorithms. This method first identifies the baseline shifts and corrects them using a spline interpolation method or targeted principal component analysis. The remaining spikes, on the other hand, are corrected by smoothing methods: Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering or robust locally weighted regression and smoothing. We have compared our new approach with the existing correction algorithms in terms of hemodynamic response function estimation using the following metrics: meansquared error, peak-to-peak error (Ep), Pearson's correlation (R2), and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. We found that spline-SG hybrid method provides reasonable improvements in all these metrics with a relatively short computational time. The dataset and the code used in this study are made available online for the use of all interested researchers.},

Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has potential to offer a fast and non-invasive method of assessing cerebral saturation in a clinical setting, however, there are concerns that NIRS brain measures suffer contamination from superficial tissues. This study used the Valsalva manoeuver (VM) to determine whether NIRS could differentiate between superficial (from somatic tissue) and neurological changes in the context of traumatic brain injury. A potent vasopressor was used to assess the effect of reducing total haemoglobin concentration in the superficial regions of the forehead. Frequency domain NIRS measurements during the VM pre and post vasoconstrictor injection, combined with simulation data, conclusively show that NIRS can detect neurological changes, in both haemoglobin content and saturation, when positioned on the forehead. The effect of superficial contamination in this instance appeared to be insignificant, with no statistically significant change in saturation over 8 patients, even with a drop in superficial haemoglobin concentration due to the vasoconstrictor, confirmed by laser Doppler. Nevertheless, simulations indicated that the absolute values of the recovered NIRS parameters are not quantitatively accurate; however a direct comparison with invasive measures is needed to confirm this.},

abstract = {Intima-media thickness (IMT) is increasingly used as a surrogate end point of vascular outcomes in clinical trials aimed at determining the success of interventions that lower risk factors for atherosclerosis and associated diseases (stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral artery diseases). The necessity to promote further criteria to distinguish early atherosclerotic plaque formation from thickening of IMT and to standardize IMT measurements is expressed through this updated consensus. Plaque is defined as a focal structure that encroaches into the arterial lumen of at least 0.5 mm or 50{\%} of the surrounding IMT value or demonstrates a thickness {\textgreater}1.5 mm as measured from the media-adventitia interface to the intima-lumen interface. Standard use of IMT measurements is based on physics, technical and disease-related principles as well as agreements on how to perform, interpret and document study results. Harmonization of carotid image acquisition and analysis is needed for the comparison of the IMT results obtained from epidemiological and interventional studies around the world. The consensus concludes that there is no need to 'treat IMT values' nor to monitor IMT values in individual patients apart from exceptions named, which emphasize that inside randomized clinical trials should be performed. Although IMT has been suggested to represent an important risk marker, according to the current evidence it does not fulfill the characteristics of an accepted risk factor. Standardized methods recommended in this consensus statement will foster homogenous data collection and analysis.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 SPIE. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has potential to offer a fast and non-invasive method of assessing cerebral saturation in a clinical setting, however, there are concerns that NIRS brain measures suffer contamination from superficial tissues. This study used the Valsalva manoeuver (VM) to determine whether NIRS could differentiate between superficial (from somatic tissue) and neurological changes in the context of traumatic brain injury. A potent vasopressor was used to assess the effect of reducing total haemoglobin concentration in the superficial regions of the forehead. Frequency domain NIRS measurements during the VM pre and post vasoconstrictor injection, combined with simulation data, conclusively show that NIRS can detect neurological changes, in both haemoglobin content and saturation, when positioned on the forehead. The effect of superficial contamination in this instance appeared to be insignificant, with no statistically significant change in saturation over 8 patients, even with a drop in superficial haemoglobin concentration due to the vasoconstrictor, confirmed by laser Doppler. Nevertheless, simulations indicated that the absolute values of the recovered NIRS parameters are not quantitatively accurate; however a direct comparison with invasive measures is needed to confirm this.},

abstract = {Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising method to study functional organization of the prefrontal cortex. However, in order to realize the high potential of fNIRS, effective discrimination between physiological noise originating from forehead skin haemodynamic and cerebral signals is required. Main sources of physiological noise are global and local blood flow regulation processes on multiple time scales. The goal of the present study was to identify the main physiological noise contributions in fNIRS forehead signals and to develop a method for physiological de-noising of fNIRS data. To achieve this goal we combined concurrent time-domain fNIRS and peripheral physiology recordings with wavelet coherence analysis (WCA). Depth selectivity was achieved by analyzing moments of photon time-of-flight distributions provided by time-domain fNIRS. Simultaneously, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and skin blood flow (SBF) on the forehead were recorded. WCA was employed to quantify the impact of physiological processes on fNIRS signals separately for different time scales. We identified three main processes contributing to physiological noise in fNIRS signals on the forehead. The first process with the period of about 3 s is induced by respiration. The second process is highly correlated with time lagged MAP and HR fluctuations with a period of about 10 s often referred as Mayer waves. The third process is local regulation of the facial SBF time locked to the task-evoked fNIRS signals. All processes affect oxygenated haemoglobin concentration more strongly than that of deoxygenated haemoglobin. Based on these results we developed a set of physiological regressors, which were used for physiological de-noising of fNIRS signals. Our results demonstrate that proposed de-noising method can significantly improve the sensitivity of fNIRS to cerebral signals. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kirlilna, Yu, Jelzow, Wabnitz, Jacobs and Tachtsidis.},

There are limited data available on the prevalence and incidence of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI) from population-based studies. The Einstein Aging Study, a systematically recruited community-based cohort of 1944 adults aged 70 or older (1168 dementia free at baseline; mean age, 78.8 y; average follow-up, 3.9 y), provides the opportunity to examine the prevalence and incidence rates for dementia, Alzheimer dementia (AD), aMCI, and naMCI by demographic characteristics. Dementia prevalence was 6.5{\%} (4.9{\%} AD). Overall dementia incidence was 2.9/100 person-years (2.3/100 person-years for AD). Dementia and AD rates increased with age but did not differ by sex. Prevalence of aMCI was 11.6{\%}, and naMCI prevalence was 9.9{\%}. aMCI incidence was 3.8 and naMCI incidence was 3.9/100 person-years. Rates of aMCI increased significantly with age in men and in blacks; sex, education, and race were not significant risk factors. In contrast, naMCI incidence did not increase with age; however, blacks were at higher risk compared with whites, even when controlling for sex and education. Results highlight the public health significance of preclinical cognitive disease.{\textcopyright} 2012 by Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Following previous Monte Carlo simulations, we describe in detail an example of detecting evoked visual hemodynamic responses in a human subject as a preliminary demonstration of the novel global interference cancellation technology. The raw time series of oxyhemoglobin (O(2)Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) changes, their block averaged results before and after adaptive filtering, together with the power spectral density analysis are presented. Simultaneous respiration and EKG recordings suggested that spontaneous low-frequency oscillation and cardiac activity were the major sources of global interference in our test. When global interference dominates (e.g., for O(2)Hb in our data, judged by power spectral density analysis), adaptive filtering effectively reduced this interference, doubling the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for evoked visual response detection. When global interference is not obvious (e.g., in our HHb data), adaptive filtering provided no CNR improvement. The results also showed that the hemodynamic changes in the superficial layers and the estimated total global interference in the target measurement were highly correlated (r=0.96), which explains why this global interference cancellation method should work well when global interference is dominating. In addition, the results suggested that association between the superficial layer hemodynamics and the total global interference is time-varying.},

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive imaging approach for measuring brain activities based on changes in the cerebral concentrations of hemoglobin. Recently, statistical analysis based on a general linear model (GLM) has become popular. Here, to impose statistical significance on the activation detected by fNIRS, family-wise error (FWE) rate control is important. However, unlike fMRI, in which measurements are densely sampled on a regular lattice and Gaussian smoothing makes the resulting random field homogeneous, the random fields from fNIRS are inhomogeneous due to the interpolation from sparsely and irregularly distributed optode locations. Thus, tube formula based correction has been proposed to address this issue. However, Sun's tube formula cannot be used for general random fields such as F-statistics. To overcome these difficulties, we employ the expected Euler characteristic approach based on Lipschitz-Killing curvature (LKC) to control the family-wise error rate. We compared this correction method with Sun's tube formula for t-statistics to confirm the existing method. Based on this comparison, we show that covariance estimation should be modified to consider channel-wise least-square residual correlation. These new results supplement the existing tool of statistical parameter mapping for fNIRS. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Vascular problems increase Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but the nature of this relationship remains unclear. Older adults having genetic risk for AD show regionally increased functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity during memory, possibly representing compensation for a genetically induced neural deficit. We investigated whether vascular health risks, which similarly could lead to neuropsychological deficits, also showed increased fMRI activity during a memory task performed by 30 cognitively intact, primarily normotensive older adults (mean age. =. 61). Vascular risk measures included systolic blood pressure (sBP), body mass index (BMI), and total cholesterol. Higher sBP and BMI (but not total cholesterol) were significantly correlated with increased activation in posterior cingulate cortex and frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. In posterior cingulate and parietal cortices, these relationships were evident even within sBP and BMI ranges considered normal, and were independent of hippocampal volume. Our results are similar to those in prior AD risk research, and suggest that fMRI reveals an abnormal response to cognitive processes in cognitively intact older adults with increased vascular risk. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Frontotemporal dementia is a highly heritable neurodegenerative disorder. In about a third of patients, the disease is caused by autosomal dominant genetic mutations usually in one of three genes: progranulin (. GRN), microtubule-associated protein tau (. MAPT), or chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (. C9orf72). Findings from studies of other genetic dementias have shown neuroimaging and cognitive changes before symptoms onset, and we aimed to identify whether such changes could be shown in frontotemporal dementia. Methods: We recruited participants to this multicentre study who either were known carriers of a pathogenic mutation in GRN, MAPT, or C9orf72, or were at risk of carrying a mutation because a first-degree relative was a known symptomatic carrier. We calculated time to expected onset as the difference between age at assessment and mean age at onset within the family. Participants underwent a standardised clinical assessment and neuropsychological battery. We did MRI and generated cortical and subcortical volumes using a parcellation of the volumetric T1-weighted scan. We used linear mixed-effects models to examine whether the association of neuropsychology and imaging measures with time to expected onset of symptoms differed between mutation carriers and non-carriers. Findings: Between Jan 30, 2012, and Sept 15, 2013, we recruited participants from 11 research sites in the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada. We analysed data from 220 participants: 118 mutation carriers (40 symptomatic and 78 asymptomatic) and 102 non-carriers. For neuropsychology measures, we noted the earliest significant differences between mutation carriers and non-carriers 5 years before expected onset, when differences were significant for all measures except for tests of immediate recall and verbal fluency. We noted the largest Z score differences between carriers and non-carriers 5 years before expected onset in tests of naming (Boston Naming Test -0{\textperiodcentered}7; SE 0{\textperiodcentered}3) and executive function (Trail Making Test Part B, Digit Span backwards, and Digit Symbol Task, all -0{\textperiodcentered}5, SE 0{\textperiodcentered}2). For imaging measures, we noted differences earliest for the insula (at 10 years before expected symptom onset, mean volume as a percentage of total intracranial volume was 0{\textperiodcentered}80{\%} in mutation carriers and 0{\textperiodcentered}84{\%} in non-carriers; difference -0{\textperiodcentered}04, SE 0{\textperiodcentered}02) followed by the temporal lobe (at 10 years before expected symptom onset, mean volume as a percentage of total intracranial volume 8{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} in mutation carriers and 8{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} in non-carriers; difference -0{\textperiodcentered}2, SE 0{\textperiodcentered}1). Interpretation: Structural imaging and cognitive changes can be identified 5-10 years before expected onset of symptoms in asymptomatic adults at risk of genetic frontotemporal dementia. These findings could help to define biomarkers that can stage presymptomatic disease and track disease progression, which will be important for future therapeutic trials.

abstract = {The integrity of the frontal areas of the brain, specifically the prefrontal cortex, are critical to preserve cognition and mobility in late life. Prefrontal cortex regions are involved in executive functions and gait control and have been related to the performance of dual-tasks. Dual-task performance assessment may help identify older adults at risk of negative health outcomes. As an alternative to neuroimaging techniques that do not allow assessment during actual motion, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive technique that can assess neural activation through the measurement of cortical oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels, while the person is performing a motor task in a natural environment as well as during cognitive tasks. The aim of this review was to describe the use of fNIRS to study frontal lobe hemodynamics during cognitive, motor and dual-tasks in older adults. From the 46 included publications, 20 studies used only cognitive tasks, three studies used motor tasks and 23 used dual-tasks. Our findings suggest that fNIRS detects changes in frontal activation in older adults (cognitively healthy and mild cognitive impairment), especially while performing cognitive and dual-tasks. In both the comparison between older and younger adults, and in people with different neurological conditions, compared to healthier controls, the prefrontal cortex seems to experience a higher activation, which could be interpreted in the context of proposed neural inefficiency and limited capacity models. Further research is needed to establish standardized fNIRS protocols, study the cerebral hemodynamic in different neurological and systemic conditions that might influence cortical activation and explore its role in predicting incident health outcomes such as dementia.},

However, whether there is a change of neuronal activity in individuals with asymptomatic vulnerable carotid plaque but mild stenosis (VCP) remains unknown. Methods: From December 2015 to December 2017, a total of 31 patients with VCP and 31 no carotid plaque (NCP) controls were performed multi-modal state functional magnetic resonance imaging and investigated the regional brain activity and FC. Two basic algorithms of rs-fMRI, arterial spin labeling, and inflammatory biomarkers were comprehensively evaluated. The time series of aberrant ReHo and FC were also extracted and correlated with other clinical imaging features. Results: As compared with NCP group, decreased regional brain activity was found mainly in left middle occipital gyrus (MOG) in the VCP group, but there was no significant difference in cerebral blood flow between the two groups. With the left MOG as seed, decreased FC was found between left MOG and right MOG and frontoparietal network in VCP group. Carotid intima-media thickness but not inflammatory biomarkers including high sensitivity c-reactive protein and interleukin-6 was significantly correlated with aberrant ReHo and FC in left MOG and right MOG. Conclusions: regional brain activity and FC may serve as early imaging markers for vascular-related brain dysfunctions and clinical indicators for early intervention of both atherosclerotic cerebral infarction and vascular cognitive impairments.},

A few studies have shown that early bilingualism shapes interference suppression but not response inhibition skills, however current behavioral measures do not fully allow us to disentangle these subcomponents. Lateralized Readiness Potentials (LRPs) are centroparietal event-related potentials (ERPs) that track motor response-preparations between stimulus-presentation and behavioral responses. We examine LRPs elicited during successful inhibitory control on a nonverbal Stroop task, in 6–8 year-old bilingual (n = 44) and monolingual (n = 48) children from comparable socio-economic backgrounds. Relative to monolinguals, bilinguals showed longer and stronger incorrect-response preparations, and a more mature pattern of correct-response preparation (shorter peak-latencies), underlying correct responses on Stroop-interference trials. Neural markers of response-inhibition were comparable between groups and no behavioral differences were found between-groups on the Stroop task. Results suggest group differences in underlying mechanisms of centroparietal motor-response preparation mechanisms in this age group, contrary to what has been shown using behavioral tasks previously. We discuss neural results in the context of speed-accuracy trade-offs. This is the first study to examine neural markers of motor-responses in bilingual children.},

However, performance in a single test is generally not indicative of AD. Functional neuroimaging, such as functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), may be employed during these tests in an ecological setting to support diagnosis. Indeed, neuroimaging should not alter clinical practice allowing free doctor-patient interaction. However, block-designed paradigms, necessary for standard functional neuroimaging analysis, require tests adaptation. Novel signal analysis procedures (e.g., signal complexity evaluation) may be useful to establish brain signals differences without altering experimental conditions. In this study, we estimated fNIRS complexity (through Sample Entropy metric) in frontal cortex of early AD and controls during three tests that assess visuo-spatial and short-term-memory abilities (Clock Drawing Test, Digit Span Test, Corsi Block Tapping Test). A channel-based analysis of fNIRS complexity during the tests revealed AD-induced changes. Importantly, a multivariate analysis of fNIRS complexity provided good specificity and sensitivity to AD. This outcome was compared to cognitive tests performances that were predictive of AD in only one test. Our results demonstrated the capabilities of fNIRS and complexity metric to support early AD diagnosis.},

In 11 healthy humans, beat-to-beat blood pressure (radial arterial), middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv; transcranial Doppler ultrasound), end-tidal Pco(2), and cerebral oxygenation (near infrared spectroscopy) were recorded continuously during pharmacological-induced changes in mean blood pressure. In a randomized order, steady-state decreases and increases in mean blood pressure (8 to 14 levels; range: approximately 40 to approximately 125 mm Hg) were achieved using intravenous infusions of sodium nitroprusside or phenylephrine, respectively. MCAv(mean) was altered by 0.82+/-0.35{\%} per millimeter of mercury change in mean blood pressure (R(2)=0.82). Changes in cortical oxygenation index were inversely related to changes in mean blood pressure (slope=-0.18{\%}/mm Hg; R(2)=0.60) and MCAv(mean) (slope=-0.26{\%}/cm . s(-1); R(2)=0.54). There was a progressive increase in MCAv pulsatility with hypotension. These findings indicate that cerebral blood flow closely follows pharmacological-induced changes in blood pressure in otherwise healthy humans. Thus, a finite slope of the plateau region does not necessarily imply a defective CA. Moreover, with progressive hypotension and hypertension there are differential changes in cerebral oxygenation and MCAv(mean).},

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to describe a first approach to a smart bioimpedance spectroscopy device for its application to the estimation of body composition. The proposed device is capable of carrying out bioimpedance measurements in multiple configurable frequencies, processing the data to obtain the modulus and the bioimpedance phase in each of the frequencies, and transmitting the processed information wirelessly. Another novelty of this work is a new algorithm for the identification of Cole model parameters, which is the basis of body composition estimation through bioimpedance spectroscopy analysis. Against other proposals, the main advantages of the proposed method are its robustness against parasitic effects by employing an extended version of Cole model with phase delay and three dispersions, its simplicity and low computational load. The results obtained in a validation study with respiratory patients show the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed technology for bioimpedance measurements. The precision and validity of the algorithm was also proven in a validation study with peritoneal dialysis patients. The proposed method was the most accurate compared with other existing algorithms. Moreover, in those cases affected by parasitic effects the proposed algorithm provided better approximations to the bioimpedance values than a reference device.},

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique that uses low levels of light to measure changes in cerebral blood oxygenation levels. In the majority of NIRS functional brain studies, analysis of this data is based on a statistical comparison of hemodynamic levels between a baseline and task or between multiple task conditions by means of a linear regression model: the so-called general linear model. Although these methods are similar to their implementation in other fields, particularly for functional magnetic resonance imaging, the specific application of these methods in fNIRS research differs in several key ways related to the sources of noise and artifacts unique to fNIRS. In this brief communication, we discuss the application of linear regression models in fNIRS and the modifications needed to generalize these models in order to deal with structured (colored) noise due to systemic physiology and noise heteroscedasticity due to motion artifacts. The objective of this work is to present an overview of these noise properties in the context of the linear model as it applies to fNIRS data. This work is aimed at explaining these mathematical issues to the general fNIRS experimental researcher but is not intended to be a complete mathematical treatment of these concepts.},

abstract = {Cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is being debated whether this reflects diminished demand because of advanced neurodegeneration or that cerebral hypoperfusion contributes to dementia. We examined the relation of CBF velocity as measured with transcranial Doppler with dementia and markers of incipient dementia (ie, cognitive decline and hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging) in 1,730 participants of the Rotterdam Study aged 55 years and older. Cognitive decline in the 6.5 years preceding CBF velocity measurement was assessed with repeated Mini-Mental State Examinations in nondemented subjects (n = 1,716). Hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were assessed in a subset of 170 nondemented subjects. Subjects with greater CBF velocity were less likely to have dementia. Furthermore, in nondemented subjects, greater CBF velocity was related to significantly less cognitive decline over the preceding period (odds ratio per standard deviation increase in mean CBF 0.74 [95{\%} confidence interval, 0.58-0.98]) and larger hippocampal and amygdalar volumes. A low CBF is associated with dementia, but also with markers of incipient dementia. Although we cannot exclude that this is caused by preclinical neurodegeneration leading to hypoperfusion, it does suggest that cerebral hypoperfusion precedes and possibly contributes to onset of clinical dementia. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Neurological Association.},

abstract = {Near-infrared imaging (NIRI) is a neuroimaging technique which enables us to non-invasively measure hemodynamic changes in the human brain. Since the technique is very sensitive, the movement of a subject can cause movement artifacts (MAs), which affect the signal quality and results to a high degree. No general method is yet available to reduce these MAs effectively. The aim was to develop a new MA reduction method. A method based on moving standard deviation and spline interpolation was developed. It enables the semi-automatic detection and reduction of MAs in the data. It was validated using simulated and real NIRI signals. The results show that a significant reduction of MAs and an increase in signal quality are achieved. The effectiveness and usability of the method is demonstrated by the improved detection of evoked hemodynamic responses. The present method can not only be used in the postprocessing of NIRI signals but also for other kinds of data containing artifacts, for example ECG or EEG signals. {\textcopyright} 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

In 10 normal subjects and 10 patients with CHF, standard hemodynamic variables, mean ankle vein pressure (MAVP), and FABF with Doppler techniques were obtained during graded upright bicycle exercise. To evaluate a nonspecific blood flow response, normal subjects also performed supine exercise. In normal subjects, MAVP rapidly declined by 45 mmHg and FABF correspondingly increased 5.3-fold without a systemic pressor response during 10 s of light upright exercise at 5 W. Approximately 67{\%} of the blood flow response was attributed to the venous pressure drop-dependent mechanism. In CHF patients, MAVP declined by only 36 mmHg and FABF increased only 1.7-fold during the same upright exercise. The muscle venous pump has an ability to increase FABF at least threefold via the venous pressure drop-dependent mechanism. This mechanism is impaired in CHF patients.},

NIRS and DOI offer the potential to quantify changes in deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) and total hemoglobin (HbT) concentration, thus enabling distinction of oxygen consumption and blood flow changes during brain activation. While the techniques implemented presently provide important results for cognition and the neurosciences through their relative measures of HbR and HbT concentrations, there is much to be done to improve sensitivity, accuracy, and resolution. In this paper, we review the advances currently being made and issues to consider for improving optical image quality. These include the optimal selection of wavelengths to minimize random and systematic error propagation in the calculation of the hemoglobin concentrations, the filtering of systemic physiological signal clutter to improve sensitivity to the hemodynamic response to brain activation, the implementation of overlapping measurements to improve image spatial resolution and uniformity, and the utilization of spatial prior information from structural and functional MRI to reduce DOI partial volume error and improve image quantitative accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Functional cranial near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been widely used to investigate the haemodynamic changes which occur in response to functional activation. The technique exploits the different absorption spectra of oxy-and deoxy-haemoglobin ([HbO 2 ] [HHb] ) in the near-infrared region to measure the changes in oxygenation and haemodynamics in the cortical tissue. The aim of this study was to use an optical topography system to produce topographic maps of the haemodynamic response of both frontal cortex (FC) and motor cortex (MC) during anagram solving while simultaneously monitoring the systemic physiology (mean blood pressure, heart rate, scalp flux). A total of 22 young healthy adults were studied. The activation paradigm comprised of 4-, 6-and 8-letter anagrams. 12 channels of the optical topography system were positioned over the FC and 12 channels over the MC. During the task 12 subjects demonstrated a significant change in at least one systemic variable (p≤0.05). Statistical analysis of task-related changes in [HbO 2 ] and [HHb] , based on a Student's t-test was insufficient to distinguish between cortical haemodynamic activation and systemic interference. This lead to false positive haemodynamic maps of activation. It is therefore necessary to use statistical testing that incorporates the systemic changes that occur during brain activation. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

abstract = {With the advent of multi-channel EEG hardware systems and the concurrent development of topographic and tomographic signal source localization methods, the international 10/20 system, a standard system for electrode positioning with 21 electrodes, was extended to higher density electrode settings such as 10/10 and 10/5 systems, allowing more than 300 electrode positions. However, their effectiveness as relative head-surface-based positioning systems has not been examined. We previously developed a virtual 10/20 measurement algorithm that can analyze any structural MR head and brain image. Extending this method to the virtual 10/10 and 10/5 measurement algorithms, we analyzed the MR images of 17 healthy subjects. The acquired scalp positions of the 10/10 and 10/5 systems were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic coordinates and their spatial variability was assessed. We described and examined the effects of spatial variability due to the selection of positioning systems and landmark placement strategies. As long as a detailed rule for a particular system was provided, it yielded precise landmark positions on the scalp. Moreover, we evaluated the effective spatial resolution of 329 scalp landmark positions of the 10/5 system for multi-subject studies. As long as a detailed rule for landmark setting was provided, 241 scalp positions could be set effectively when there was no overlapping of two neighboring positions. Importantly, 10/10 positions could be well separated on a scalp without overlapping. This study presents a referential framework for establishing the effective spatial resolutions of 10/20, 10/10, and 10/5 systems as relative head-surface-based positioning systems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Besides memory and language, executive functions are very often affected in elderly and patients with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. However, the neural alterations associated with these executive deficits are still not fully understood. Therefore, we measured cortical activation using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in 16 healthy elderly subjects (50-75. years) performing the Trail Making Test (TMT), a widely used neuropsychological instrument measuring executive function. In line with previous studies focusing on younger subjects, the results showed frontal activation during the TMT A and the TMT B in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the frontopolar area and also Broca's area. Furthermore, significant activation in the left motor, somatosensory cortices and somatosensory association cortices was demonstrated. Additionally, after a median split the differences between younger ({\textless}. 58. years) and older ({\textgreater}. 58. years) subjects were analyzed with the older subjects showing a less focused prefrontal activation. Altogether, fNIRS was found to be suitable to detect cortical activation in elderly subjects during performance of the TMT as well as aging-related differences in prefrontal activation topography. These neural correlates of executive functions should be further investigated as a potential prodromal neural marker of executive deficits and neurodegenerative processes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Calcification volume measured with computed tomography (CT) is a valid marker of atherosclerosis. This study investigates associations of atherosclerosis (measured using CT) at four locations with cognition and brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: To quantify calcification volume, 2414 nondemented people from the Rotterdam Study underwent CT of the coronary arteries, aortic arch, extracranial carotid arteries, and intracranial carotid arteries. To assess global cognition and performance on memory, executive function, information processing speed, and motor speed, they also underwent neuropsychological tests. In a random subgroup of 844 participants, brain MRI was performed. Automated segmentation and quantification of brain MRI scans yielded brain tissue volumes in milliliters. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to measure the microstructural integrity of the white matter. Relationships of atherosclerotic calcification with cognition, brain tissue volumes, and diffusion tensor imaging measures were assessed with linear regression models and adjusted for relevant confounders. Results: With larger calcification volumes, lower cognitive scores were observed. When calcification volumes were larger, total brain volumes were also smaller. Specifically, larger coronary artery calcification volumes related to smaller gray matter volumes, and extracranial and intracranial carotid calcification volumes related to smaller white matter volumes. Larger calcification volume in all vessel beds was accompanied by worse microstructural integrity of the white matter. Conclusions: Larger calcification volume is associated with worse cognitive performance. It also relates to smaller brain tissue volumes and worse white matter microstructural integrity, revealing possible mechanisms through which atherosclerosis may lead to poorer cognition. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Alzheimer's Association.

abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an emerging non-invasive tool for functional neuroimaging, has evolved as a multichannel technique allowing simultaneous measurements through many channels ranging from below ten to above hundred. Simultaneous testing of such a large number of channels escalates the risk of Type I error, therefore multiplicity correction is unavoidable. To date, only a few studies have considered this issue using Bonferroni correction, which is an effective conservative solution, but may be too severe for neuroimaging. Its power varies in inverse proportion of the number of channels, which varies among NIRS studies depending on selected region of interest (ROI), thereby leading to a subjective inference. This problem may be well circumvented by a more contemporary approach, called false discovery rate (FDR) that is widely being adopted in functional neuroimaging. An FDR-based procedure controls the expected proportion of erroneously rejected hypotheses among the rejected hypotheses, which offers a more objective, powerful, and consistent measure of Type I error than Bonferroni correction and maintains a better balance between power and specificity. In this technical note, we examine FDR approach using examples from simulated and real NIRS data. The FDR-based procedure could yield 52{\%} more power than Bonferroni correction in a 172-channel real NIRS study and proved to be more robust against the changing number of channels. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: The evidence base on the prevalence of dementia is expanding rapidly, particularly in countries with low and middle incomes. A reappraisal of global prevalence and numbers is due, given the significant implications for social and public policy and planning. Methods: In this study we provide a systematic review of the global literature on the prevalence of dementia (1980-2009) and metaanalysis to estimate the prevalence and numbers of those affected, aged ≥60 years in 21 Global Burden of Disease regions. Results: Age-standardized prevalence for those aged ≥60 years varied in a narrow band, 5{\%}-7{\%} in most world regions, with a higher prevalence in Latin America (8.5{\%}), and a distinctively lower prevalence in the four sub-Saharan African regions (2{\%}-4{\%}). It was estimated that 35.6 million people lived with dementia worldwide in 2010, with numbers expected to almost double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. In 2010, 58{\%} of all people with dementia lived in countries with low or middle incomes, with this proportion anticipated to rise to 63{\%} in 2030 and 71{\%} in 2050. Conclusion: The detailed estimates in this study constitute the best current basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources in dementia care. The age-specific prevalence of dementia varies little between world regions, and may converge further. Future projections of numbers of people with dementia may be modified substantially by preventive interventions (lowering incidence), improvements in treatment and care (prolonging survival), and disease-modifying interventions (preventing or slowing progression). All countries need to commission nationally representative surveys that are repeated regularly to monitor trends. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: There is growing interest in the relationship between time spent in adverse circumstances across life course and increased risk of chronic disease and early mortality. This accumulation hypothesis is usually tested by summing indicators of binary variables across the life span to form an overall score that is then used as the exposure in regression models for health outcomes. This article highlights potential issues in the interpretation of results obtained from such an approach. Methods: We propose a model-building framework that can be used to formally compare alternative hypotheses on the effect of multiple binary exposure measurements collected across the life course. The saturated model where the order and value of the binary variable at each time point influence the outcome of interest is compared with nested alternative specifications corresponding to the critical period, cumulative risk or hypotheses about the effect of changes in environment. This framework is illustrated with data on adult body mass index and socioeconomic position measured once in childhood and twice in adulthood from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, using a series of liner regression models. Results: We demonstrate how analyses that only consider the association of a cumulative score with a later outcome may produce misleading results. Conclusion: We recommend comparing a set of nested models - each corresponding to the accumulation, critical period and effect modification hypotheses - to an all-inclusive (saturated) model. This approach can provide a formal and clearer understanding of the relative merits of these alternative hypotheses. {\textcopyright} Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association {\textcopyright} The Author 2008; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Brain imaging studies have reported age-related differences in brain activation for attentional control functions, such as inhibition and task-switching. However, age-related differences in brain activation patterns in more than one attentional control task have rarely been studied in the same group of participants. In this study, younger and older adults completed a modified Stroop task with interference and switching conditions, using functional near infra-red spectroscopy. While interference did not reveal any significant activation of the prefrontal cortex in younger adults, switching produced an increased activation bilaterally in both the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). In older adults, an isolated right and left anterior DLPFC activation was observed even in the non-executive conditions of the Stroop task (color denomination) and the interference condition revealed activation mostly in the posterior left DLPFC and bilateral VLPFC with a small right anterior DLPFC component. Specific to older adults, switching induced an increased activation spread out bilaterally over the prefrontal cortex in the bilateral anterior DLPFC, the posterior left DLPFC and bilateral VLPFC. These results suggest that for both older and younger adults, inhibition and switching are associated with distinct patterns of prefrontal activation and that age-related differences exist in these patterns such that prefrontal activation seems to be more spread out at different sites in older adults. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Following previous Monte Carlo simulations, we describe in detail an example of detecting evoked visual hemodynamic responses in a human subject as a preliminary demonstration of the novel global interference cancellation technology. The raw time series of oxyhemoglobin (O(2)Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) changes, their block averaged results before and after adaptive filtering, together with the power spectral density analysis are presented. Simultaneous respiration and EKG recordings suggested that spontaneous low-frequency oscillation and cardiac activity were the major sources of global interference in our test. When global interference dominates (e.g., for O(2)Hb in our data, judged by power spectral density analysis), adaptive filtering effectively reduced this interference, doubling the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for evoked visual response detection. When global interference is not obvious (e.g., in our HHb data), adaptive filtering provided no CNR improvement. The results also showed that the hemodynamic changes in the superficial layers and the estimated total global interference in the target measurement were highly correlated (r=0.96), which explains why this global interference cancellation method should work well when global interference is dominating. In addition, the results suggested that association between the superficial layer hemodynamics and the total global interference is time-varying.},

Lower systemic blood flow may have implications for dementia among older adults. Methods and Results - A total of 1039 Framingham Offspring Cohort participants free of clinical stroke, transient ischemic attack, and dementia formed our sample (age, 69±6 years; 53{\%} women). Multivariable-adjusted proportional hazard models adjusting for Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score (age, sex, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, cardiovascular disease history, atrial fibrillation), education, and apolipoprotein E4 status related cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-assessed cardiac index (cardiac output divided by body surface area) to incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD). Over the median 7.7-year follow-up period, 32 participants developed dementia, including 26 cases of AD. Each 1-SD unit decrease in cardiac index increased the relative risk of both dementia (hazard ratio [HR]=1.66; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.47; P=0.013) and AD (HR=1.65; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-2.54; P=0.022). Compared with individuals with normal cardiac index, individuals with clinically low cardiac index had a higher relative risk of dementia (HR=2.07; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-4.19; P=0.044).

Psychopathology was assessed with parent-report questionnaires at ages 11, 14, 16, and 19, and EF with tasks from the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks program at ages 11 and 19. Bi-factor models were fitted to the data using confirmatory factor analysis. Correlations were estimated to study the associations between general or specific components of both psychopathology and EF.Results A bi-factor model with a general psychopathology factor, alongside internalizing (INT), externalizing, attention deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD), and autism spectrum (ASD) problem domains, and a bi-factor model with a general EF factor, alongside specific EFs were adequately fitting measurement models. The best-fitting model between EF and psychopathology showed substantial associations of specific EFs with the general psychopathology factor, in addition to distinct patterns of association with ASD, ADHD, and INT problems.Conclusions By studying very diverse psychopathology domains simultaneously, we show how EF impairments cross diagnostic boundaries. In addition to this generic relation, ADHD, ASD, and INT symptomatology show separable profiles of EF impairments. Thus, inconsistent findings in the literature may be explained by substantial transdiagnostic EF impairments. Whether general EF or specific EFs are related to psychopathology needs to be further studied, as differences in fit between these models were small.},

This allows determination of local skeletal muscle O2 saturation, muscle oxygen consumption ( V˙O2 ) and blood flow. This article provides a brief overview of the use of CW NIRS to measure exercise-limiting factors in skeletal muscle. Recent findings NIRS parameters that measure O2 delivery and capacity to utilise O2 in the muscle have been developed based on response to physiological interventions and exercise. NIRS has good reproducibility and agreement with gold standard techniques and can be used in clinical populations where muscle oxidative capacity or oxygen delivery (or both) are impaired. CW NIRS has limitations including: the unknown contribution of myoglobin to the overall signals, the impact of adipose tissue thickness, skin perfusion during exercise, and variations in skin pigmentation. These, in the main, can be circumvented through appropriate study design or measurement of absolute tissue saturation. Summary CW NIRS can assess skeletal muscle O2 delivery and utilisation without the use of expensive or invasive procedures and is useable in large population-based samples, including older adults.},

abstract = {Clinical annotations, such as voxel-wise binary or probabilistic tissue segmentations, structural parcellations, pathological regions-of-interest and anatomical landmarks are key to many clinical studies. However, due to the time consuming nature of manually generating these annotations, they tend to be scarce and limited to small subsets of data. This work explores a novel framework to propagate voxel-wise annotations between morphologically dissimilar images by diffusing and mapping the available examples through intermediate steps. A spatially-variant graph structure connecting morphologically similar subjects is introduced over a database of images, enabling the gradual diffusion of information to all the subjects, even in the presence of large-scale morphological variability. We illustrate the utility of the proposed framework on two example applications: brain parcellation using categorical labels and tissue segmentation using probabilistic features. The application of the proposed method to categorical label fusion showed highly statistically significant improvements when compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. Significant improvements were also observed when applying the proposed framework to probabilistic tissue segmentation of both synthetic and real data, mainly in the presence of large morphological variability.},

abstract = {For functional neuroimaging with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), we recently introduced a probabilistic registration method that uses a reference magnetic resonance image (MRI) database instead of the subject's own MRI, and probabilistically registers the NIRS optode or channel positions onto a canonical brain template in the standard stereotactic brain coordinate systems. As an alternative method, we devised an anchor-based registration method utilizing roughly obtained anchor positions on the scalp instead of strictly defined landmarks such as 10/20 landmarks. This method uses a spherical coordinate system to seek a position in the reference MRI database that corresponds to the anchor position, and eventually presents NIRS optode and channel positions in the standard stereotactic brain coordinate system. For comparison against conventional probabilistic registration, we simulated NIRS optode holder placement on 100 synthesized virtual heads, and found holistic tendencies for probe position estimations were similar between the two methods. Comparison among anchor-based probabilistic registration, conventional probabilistic registration, and SPM-based registration via co-registration to a subject's own MRI revealed that intra-method variability was comparable to a small inter-method variability. Thus, anchor-based registration is a practical alternative, especially to avoid burdening a subject and to reduce experimental time. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.},

abstract = {Cognitive control over conflicting information has been studied extensively using tasks such as the color-word Stroop, flanker, and spatial conflict task. Neuroimaging studies typically identify a fronto-parietal network engaged in conflict processing, but numerous additional regions are also reported. Ascribing putative functional roles to these regions is problematic because some may have less to do with conflict processing per se, but could be engaged in specific processes related to the chosen stimulus modality, stimulus feature, or type of conflict task. In addition, some studies contrast activation on incongruent and congruent trials, even though a neutral baseline is needed to separate the effect of inhibition from that of facilitation. In the first part of this article, we report a systematic review of 34 neuroimaging publications, which reveals that conflict-related activity is reliably reported in the anterior cingulate cortex and bilaterally in the lateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior insula, and the parietal lobe. In the second part, we further explore these candidate "conflict" regions through a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, in which the same group of subjects perform related visual and auditory Stroop tasks. By carefully controlling for the same task (Stroop), the same to-be-ignored stimulus dimension (word meaning), and by separating out inhibitory processes from those of facilitation, we attempt to minimize the potential differences between the two tasks. The results provide converging evidence that the regions identified by the systematic review are reliably engaged in conflict processing. Despite carefully matching the Stroop tasks, some regions of differential activity remained, particularly in the parietal cortex. We discuss some of the task-specific processes which might account for this finding. {\textcopyright} 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), considered the commonest neurodegenerative cause of dementia, is associated with hallmark pathologies including extracellular amyloid-$\beta$ protein (A$\beta$) deposition in extracellular senile plaques and vessels, and intraneuronal tau deposition as neurofibrillary tangles. Although AD is usually categorized as neurodegeneration distinct from cerebrovascular disease (CVD), studies have shown strong links between AD and CVD. There is evidence that vascular risk factors and CVD may accelerate A$\beta$ 40-42 production/ aggregation/deposition and contribute to the pathology and symptomatology of AD. A$\beta$ deposited along vessels also causes cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Amyloid imaging allows in vivo detection of AD pathology, opening the way for prevention and early treatment, if disease-modifying therapies in the pipeline show safety and efficacy. In this review, we review the role of vascular factors and A$\beta$, underlining that vascular risk factor management may be important for AD prevention and treatment.

abstract = {In previous work we introduced a novel method for reducing global interference, based on adaptive filtering, to improve the contrast to noise ratio (CNR) of evoked hemodynamic responses measured non-invasively with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Here, we address the issue of how to generally apply the proposed adaptive filtering method. A total of 156 evoked visual response measurements, collected from 15 individuals, were analyzed. The similarity (correlation) between measurements with far and near source-detector separations collected during the rest period before visual stimulation was used as indicator of global interference dominance. A detailed analysis of CNR improvement in oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb), as a function of the rest period correlation coefficient, is presented. Results show that for O2Hb measurements, 66{\%} exhibited substantial global interference. For this dataset, dominated by global interference, 71{\%} of the measurements revealed CNR improvements after adaptive filtering, with a mean CNR improvement of 60{\%}. No CNR improvement was observed for HHb. This study corroborates our previous finding that adaptive filtering provides an effective method to increase CNR when there is strong global interference, and also provides a practical way for determining when and where to apply this technique. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy and near-infrared imaging enable the measurement of relative concentration changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and thus hemodynamics and oxygenation. The accuracy of determined changes depends mainly on the modeling of the light transport through the probed tissue. Due to the highly scattering nature of tissue, the light path is longer than the source-detector separation (d). This is incorporated in modeling by multiplying d by a differential pathlength factor (DPF) which depends on several factors such as wavelength, age of the subject, and type of tissue. In the present work, we derive a general DPF equation for the frontal human head, incorporating dependency on wavelength and age, based on published data. We validated the equation using different data sets of experimentally determined DPFs from six independent studies.},

So far, different NIRS techniques (e.g. continuous-wave (CW) and spatially, time- and frequency-resolved spectroscopy) have been used for measuring muscle oxygenation during exercise. In the last four years, approximately 160 muscle NIRS articles have been published on different physiological aspects (primarily muscle oxygenation and haemodynamics) of several upper- and lower-limb muscle groups investigated by using mainly two-channel CW and spatially resolved spectroscopy commercial instruments. Unfortunately, in only 15 of these studies were the advantages of using multi-channel instruments exploited. There are still several open questions in the application of NIRS in muscle studies: (i) whether NIRS can be used in subjects with a large fat layer; (ii) the contribution of myoglobin desaturation to the NIRS signal during exercise; (iii) the effect of scattering changes during exercise; and (iv) the effect of changes in skin perfusion, particularly during prolonged exercise. Recommendations for instrumentation advancements and future muscle NIRS studies are provided. Keywords:},

abstract = {The cerebral microcirculation holds a critical position to match the high metabolic demand by neuronal activity. Functionally, microcirculation is virtually inseparable from other nervous system cells under both physiological and pathological conditions. For successful bench-to-bedside translation of neuroprotection research, the role of microcirculation in acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders appears to be under-recognized, which may have contributed to clinical trial failures with some neuroprotectants. Increasing data over the last decade suggest that microcirculatory impairments such as endothelial or pericyte dysfunction, morphological irregularities in capillaries or frequent dynamic stalls in blood cell flux resulting in excessive heterogeneity in capillary transit may significantly compromise tissue oxygen availability. We now know that ischemia-induced persistent abnormalities in capillary flow negatively impact restoration of reperfusion after recanalization of occluded cerebral arteries. Similarly, microcirculatory impairments can accompany or even precede neural loss in animal models of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Macrovessels are relatively easy to evaluate with radiological or experimental imaging methods but they cannot faithfully reflect the downstream microcirculatory disturbances, which may be quite heterogeneous across the tissue at microscopic scale and/or happen fast and transiently. The complexity and size of the elements of microcirculation, therefore, require utilization of cutting-edge imaging techniques with high spatiotemporal resolution as well as multidisciplinary team effort to disclose microvascular-neurodegenerative connection and to test treatment approaches to advance the field. Developments in two photon microscopy, ultrafast ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography provide valuable experimental tools to reveal those microscopic events with high resolution. Here, we review the up-to-date advances in understanding of the primary microcirculatory abnormalities that can result in neurodegenerative processes and the combined neurovascular protection approaches that can prevent acute as well as chronic neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can readily report on changes in blood volume and oxygenation. However, it has proved more problematic to measure real-time changes in blood flow and oxygen consumption. Here we report the development of a novel method using NIRS to measure local oxygen consumption in human muscle. The method utilizes the blood volume changes induced by the muscle pump during rhythmically contracting exercising skeletal muscle. We found that the saturation of the blood during the contraction phase was lower than that during the relaxation phase. The calculated oxygen drop was then divided by the contraction time to generate a value for the muscle oxygen consumption in the optical region of interest. As a test we measured the muscle oxygen consumption in the human vastus lateralis during exercise on a cycle ergometer by 11 trained male athletes (32 ± 11 years old) at 40{\%} and 110{\%} peak aerobic power. We saw an increase from 13.78 $\mu$mol 100 g -1 min -1 to 19.72 $\mu$mol 100 g -1 min -1 with the increase in power. The measurements are theoretically exempt from usual NIRS confounders such as myoglobin and adipose tissue and could provide a useful tool for studying human physiology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

@article{Friston2002,
abstract = {In Friston et al. ((2002) Neuroimage 16: 465-483) we introduced empirical Bayes as a potentially useful way to estimate and make inferences about effects in hierarchical models. In this paper we present a series of models that exemplify the diversity of problems that can be addressed within this framework. In hierarchical linear observation models, both classical and empirical Bayesian approaches can be framed in terms of covariance component estimation (e.g., variance partitioning). To illustrate the use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in covariance component estimation we focus first on two important problems in fMRI: nonsphericity induced by (i) serial or temporal correlations among errors and (ii) variance components caused by the hierarchical nature of multisubject studies. In hierarchical observation models, variance components at higher levels can be used as constraints on the parameter estimates of lower levels. This enables the use of parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) estimators, as distinct from classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. We develop this distinction to address: (i) The difference between response estimates based on ML and the conditional means from a Bayesian approach and the implications for estimates of intersubject variability. (ii) The relationship between fixed- and random-effect analyses. (iii) The specificity and sensitivity of Bayesian inference and, finally, (iv) the relative importance of the number of scans and subjects. The forgoing is concerned with within- and between-subject variability in multisubject hierarchical fMRI studies. In the second half of this paper we turn to Bayesian inference at the first (within-voxel) level, using PET data to show how priors can be derived from the (between-voxel) distribution of activations over the brain. This application uses exactly the same ideas and formalism but, in this instance, the second level is provided by observations over voxels as opposed to subjects. The ensuing posterior probability maps (PPMs) have enhanced anatomical precision and greater face validity, in relation to underlying anatomy. Furthermore, in comparison to conventional SPMs they are not confounded by the multiple comparison problem that, in a classical context, dictates high thresholds and low sensitivity. We conclude with some general comments on Bayesian approaches to image analysis and on some unresolved issues. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Additionally, there is often a lack of a complete description of the methods applied, necessary for study replication or for results comparison. The aims of this paper were (i) to review and investigate which information is generally included in published fNIRS papers, and (ii) to define a signal pre-processing procedure to set a common ground for standardization guidelines. To this goal, we have reviewed 110 fNIRS articles published in 2016 in the field of cognitive neuroscience, and performed a simulation analysis with synthetic fNIRS data to optimize the signal filtering step before applying the GLM method for statistical inference. Our results highlight the fact that many papers lack important information, and there is a large variability in the filtering methods used. Our simulations demonstrated that the optimal approach to remove noise and recover the hemodynamic response from fNIRS data in a GLM framework is to use a 1000th order band-pass Finite Impulse Response filter. Based on these results, we give preliminary recommendations as to the first step toward improving the analysis of fNIRS data and dissemination of the results.},

abstract = {Brain activity during a verbal fluency task (VFT) has been the target of many functional imaging studies. Most studies using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have reported major activation in the frontal pole, but those using PET or fMRI have not. This led us to hypothesize that changes in the NIRS signals measured in the forehead during VFT were due to changes in skin blood flow. To test this hypothesis, we measured NIRS signals and the Doppler tissue blood flow signals in the foreheads of 50 participants. The measurements were performed while each participant produced words during two 60-s periods with an interval of 100s. In addition to a conventional optode separation distance of 30mm (FAR channels), we used a short distance - 5mm (NEAR channels) - to measure NIRS signals that originated exclusively from surface tissues. The oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) concentration in the FAR and NEAR channels, as well as the Doppler blood flow signal, increased in a similar manner during the two periods of word production; the signal increase in the first period was twice as high as that in the second period. Accordingly, the mean changes in oxyHb concentration in the FAR channels were correlated closely with the changes in the NEAR channels (R2=0.91) and with the integrated Doppler skin blood flow signal (R2=0.94). Furthermore, task-related NIRS responses disappeared when we blocked skin blood flows by pressing a small area that covered a pair of optodes. Additionally, changes in the FAR channel signals were correlated closely with the magnitude of pulsatile waves in the Doppler signal (R2=0.92), but these signals were not highly correlated with the pulse rate (R2=0.43). These results suggest that a major part of the task-related changes in the oxyHb concentration in the forehead is due to task-related changes in the skin blood flow, which is under different autonomic control than heart rate. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Standing up shifts blood to dependent parts of the body, and blood vessels in the leg become filled. The orthostatic blood volume accumulation in the small vessels is relatively unknown, although these may contribute significantly. We hypothesized that in healthy humans exposed to the upright posture, volume accumulation in small blood vessels contributes significantly to the total fluid volume accumulated in the legs. Considering that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) tracks postural blood volume changes within the small blood vessels of the lower leg, we evaluated the NIRS-determined changes in oxygenated ($\Delta$[O2Hb]), deoxygenated ($\Delta$[HHb]) and total haemoglobin tissue concentration ($\Delta$[tHb]) and in total leg volume by strain-gauge plethysmography during 70 deg head-up tilt (HUT; n= 7). In a second experiment, spatial and temporal reproducibility were evaluated with three NIRS probes applied on two separate days (n= 8). In response to HUT, an initially fast increase in [O2Hb] was followed by a gradual decline, while [HHb] increased continuously. The increase in [tHb] during HUT was closely related to the increase in total leg volume (r2= 0.95 ± 0.03). After tilt back, [O2Hb] declined below and [HHb] remained above baseline, whereas all NIRS signals gradually returned to baseline. Spatial heterogeneity was observed, and for two probes [tHb] was highly correlated between days (r2= 0.92 ± 0.09 and 0.91 ± 0.12), but less for the third probe (r2= 0.44 ± 0.36). The results suggest a non-linear accumulation of blood volume in the small vessels of the leg, with an initial fast phase followed by a more gradual increase at least partly contributing to the relocation of fluid during orthostatic stress. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

Med. Imag. 17, 463-468) was performed. The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum. Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers of the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an improvement for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science.},

abstract = {We designed and developed a compact dual-wavelength and dual-channel time-resolved system for near-infrared spectroscopy studies of muscle and brain. The system employs pulsed diode lasers as sources, compact photomultipliers, and time-correlated single photon counting boards for detection. To exploit the full temporal and dynamic range of the acquisition technique, we implemented an approach based on wavelength space multiplexing: laser pulses at the two wavelengths are alternatively injected into the two channels by means of an optical 2×2 switch. In each detection line (i.e., in each temporal window), the distribution of photon time-of-flights at one wavelength is acquired. The proposed approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio and avoids wavelength cross-talk with respect to the typical approach based on time multiplexing. The instrument was characterized on tissue phantoms to assess its properties in terms of linearity, stability, noise, and reproducibility. Finally, it was successfully tested in preliminary in vivo measurements on muscle during standard cuff occlusion and on the brain during a motor cortex response due to hand movements. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Autonomic nervous system response is known to be highly task-dependent. The sensitivity of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements to superficial layers, parti cularly to the scalp, makes it highly susceptible to systemic physiological changes. Thus, one critical step in NIRS data processing is to remove the contribution of superficial layers to the NIRS signal and to obtain the actual brain response. This can be achieved using short separation channels that are sensitive only to the hemodynamics in the scalp. We investigated the contribution of hemodynamic fluctuations due to autonomous nervous system activation during various tasks. Our results provide clear demonstrations of the critical role of using short separation channels in NIRS measurements to disentangle differing autonomic responses from the brain activation signal of interest.},

abstract = {Task-switching (TS) paradigm is a well-known validated tool useful for exploring the neural substrates of cognitive control, in particular the activity of the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. This work is aimed at investigating how physiological aging influences hemodynamic response during the execution of a color-shape TS paradigm. A multi-channel near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure hemodynamic activity in 27 young (30.0 ± 7.9 years) and 11 elderly participants (57.2 ± 9.3 years) healthy volunteers (55{\%} male, age range: (19–69) years) during the execution of a TS paradigm. Two holders were placed symmetrically over the left/right hemispheres to record cortical activity (oxy- (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) concentration) of the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the dorsal premotor cortex (PMC) and the dorso-medial part of the superior frontal gyrus (sFG). TS paradigm requires participants to repeat the same task over a variable number of trials, and then to switch to a different task during the trial sequence. A two-sample t-test was carried out to detect differences in cortical responses between groups. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of age on the prefrontal neural activity. Elderly participants were significantly slower than young participants in both color- (p {\textless} 0.01, t = -3.67) and shape-single tasks (p = 0.026, t = -2.54) as well as switching (p = 0.026, t = -2.41) and repetition trials (p = 0.012, t = -2.80). Differences in cortical activation between groups were revealed for HbO mean concentration of switching task in the PMC (p= 0.048, t = 2.94). In the whole group, significant increases of behavioural performance were detected in switching trials, which positively correlated with aging. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the HbO mean concentration of switching task in the PMC (p=0.01, $\beta$=-0.321) and of shape single-task in the sFG (p = 0.003, $\beta$ = 0.342) were the best predictors of age effects. Our findings demonstrated that TS might be a reliable instrument to gather a measure of cognitive resources in older people. Moreover, the fNIRS-related brain activity extracted from frontoparietal cortex might become a useful indicator of aging effects.},

Several processes like neuronal activity, synaptic activity, vascular dilation, blood volume and oxygenation changes underlie both response modalities, that is, the electrophysiological signal and the vascular response. However, accessing single process relationships is absolutely mandatory when aiming at a deeper understanding of neurovascular coupling and necessitates studies on the individual building blocks of the vascular response. Combined fMRI and functional near-infrared spectroscopy studies have been performed to validate the correlation of the BOLD signal to the hemodynamic changes in the brain. Here we review the current status of the integration of both technologies and judge these studies in the light of recent findings on neurovascular coupling. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background and Purpose - The clinical application of intracranial near-infrared spectroscopy in adults has been hampered by concerns over contamination from extracranial tissues. The NIRO 300 (Hamamatsu Photonics) provides continuous online measurements of hemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase concentrations and a calculated tissue oxygen index (TOI). The present study seeks confirmation of the anatomic source of TOI in the adult cranium. Methods - Sixty patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were studied. The NIRO 300 was incorporated into an established multimodal monitoring system. TOI, oxyhemoglobin, and deoxyhemoglobin changes were assessed and compared with (1) frontal cutaneous laser-Doppler flowmetry and (2) transcranial Doppler measurement of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery flow velocity. Results - Changes in TOI were seen during cross-clamping of the carotid vessels in 49 patients (mean $\Delta$TOI=-9.4{\%}, SD=7.1). Significant correlation was seen between TOI and flow velocity (r=0.56) but not with laser-Doppler flowmetry (r=0.13). In 31 patients, oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations were recorded, showing significant changes during both external carotid artery and internal carotid artery clamping. A change in TOI was predominantly associated with internal carotid artery clamping (n=41). When TOI changed during external carotid artery clamping (n=8), significant blood pressure changes occurred, or extracranial-to-intracranial anastomosis was evident. In the absence of such variables, the sensitivity of TOI to intracranial and extracranial changes was 87.5{\%} and 0{\%}, respectively, and specificity was 100{\%} and 0{\%}, respectively. Conclusions - The NIRO 300 reflects changes in cerebral tissue oxygenation when TOI is calculated, with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.},

abstract = {It is often necessary to assess physical function in older adults to monitor disease progression, rehabilitation or decline in function with age. However, increasing frailty and poor balance that accompany aging are common barriers to exercise testing protocols. We investigated whether a 6-min stepper test (6MST) was acceptable to older adults and provided a measure of exercise capacity and a predicted value for peak aerobic capacity (VO2max). 635 older adults from a tri-ethnic UK population-based cohort were screened to undertake a self-paced 6MST. Expired gas analysis, heart rate and blood pressure monitoring were carried out. A sub-set of 20 participants performed a second 6MST for assessment of reproducibility and a further sub-set of 10 performed the 6-min walk test as verification against a well-recognized and accepted self-paced exercise test. 518 (82{\%}) participants met inclusion criteria and undertook the 6MST (299 men, mean age 71.2 ± 6.4). Step rate showed a strong positive correlation with measured VO2 (r = 0.75, p {\textless} 0.001) and VO2 was lower in women (male-female difference in VO2 = 2.61 (95{\%} confidence interval -3.6, -1.7) ml/min/kg; p {\textless} 0.001). 20 participants repeated a 6MST, step rate was higher in the second test but the predicted VO2max showed good agreement (mean difference = 0.1 [3.72, 3.95] ml/min/kg). In 10 participants who completed a 6MST and a 6-min walk test there was a strong positive correlation between walking rate and step rate (r = 0.77; p {\textless} 0.009) and weaker positive correlations between the tests for measured VO2 and peak heart rate. In conclusion, the 6MST is a convenient, acceptable method of assessing exercise capacity in older adults that allows VO2max to be predicted reproducibly. The test shows good correlation between performance and measured physiological markers of performance and can detect the expected gender differences in measured VO2. Furthermore, the 6MST results correlate with a previously verified and established self-paced exercise test.},

abstract = {Short-term cardiovascular responses to postural change from sitting to standing involve complex interactions between the autonomic nervous system, which regulates blood pressure, and cerebral autoregulation, which maintains cerebral perfusion. We present a mathematical model that can predict dynamic changes in beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity during postural change from sitting to standing. Our cardiovascular model utilizes 11 compartments to describe blood pressure, blood flow, compliance, and resistance in the heart and systemic circulation. To include dynamics due to the pulsatile nature of blood pressure and blood flow, resistances in the large systemic arteries are modeled using nonlinear functions of pressure. A physiologically based submodel is used to describe effects of gravity on venous blood pooling during postural change. Two types of control mechanisms are included: 1) autonomic regulation mediated by sympathetic and parasympathetic responses, which affect heart rate, cardiac contractility, resistance, and compliance, and 2) autoregulation mediated by responses to local changes in myogenic tone, metabolic demand, and CO2 concentration, which affect cerebrovascular resistance. Finally, we formulate an inverse least-squares problem to estimate parameters and demonstrate that our mathematical model is in agreement with physiological data from a young subject during postural change from sitting to standing.

We focused our investigation on the source analysis of the events tightly linked to movement onset, and we used brain electric source analysis (BESA) to model the sources generating MRCFs during the interval from 200 ms before to 150 ms after the movement onset. Four sources provided satisfactory solutions for MRCF activities in this interval. Sources 1 and 2, which were located in the pre-central regions in the hemisphere contralateral and ipsilateral to the moved finger, respectively, generated the readiness fields (RF), but source 1 was predominant just before movement onset. The motor field (MF), the peak of which was just after movement onset, was mainly generated by source 1. Sources 3 and 4 were located in the post-central regions in the hemisphere contralateral and ipsilateral to the moved finger, respectively. The first motor evoked field (MEF-I), the peak of which was about 80 ms after the movement, was mainly generated by source 3, but with the participation of sources 1, 2 and 4. The results indicated that the activities of both pre -and post-central regions in bilateral hemispheres were related to voluntary movements, although the predominant areas varied over time. This is the first noninvasive study to clarify the complex spatiotemporal activities relating movements in humans using a multi-channel MEG system.},

abstract = {Brain activity during a verbal fluency task (VFT) has been the target of many functional imaging studies. Most studies using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have reported major activation in the frontal pole, but those using PET or fMRI have not. This led us to hypothesize that changes in the NIRS signals measured in the forehead during VFT were due to changes in skin blood flow. To test this hypothesis, we measured NIRS signals and the Doppler tissue blood flow signals in the foreheads of 50 participants. The measurements were performed while each participant produced words during two 60-s periods with an interval of 100s. In addition to a conventional optode separation distance of 30mm (FAR channels), we used a short distance - 5mm (NEAR channels) - to measure NIRS signals that originated exclusively from surface tissues. The oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) concentration in the FAR and NEAR channels, as well as the Doppler blood flow signal, increased in a similar manner during the two periods of word production; the signal increase in the first period was twice as high as that in the second period. Accordingly, the mean changes in oxyHb concentration in the FAR channels were correlated closely with the changes in the NEAR channels (R2=0.91) and with the integrated Doppler skin blood flow signal (R2=0.94). Furthermore, task-related NIRS responses disappeared when we blocked skin blood flows by pressing a small area that covered a pair of optodes. Additionally, changes in the FAR channel signals were correlated closely with the magnitude of pulsatile waves in the Doppler signal (R2=0.92), but these signals were not highly correlated with the pulse rate (R2=0.43). These results suggest that a major part of the task-related changes in the oxyHb concentration in the forehead is due to task-related changes in the skin blood flow, which is under different autonomic control than heart rate. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction has been inconsistently associated with early cognitive impairment, and mechanistic pathways have been poorly considered. We investigated the cross-sectional relationship between LV dysfunction and structural/functional measures of the brain and explored the role of potential mechanisms. METHOD AND RESULTS: A total of 1338 individuals (69±6 years) from the Southall and Brent Revisited study underwent echocardiography for systolic (tissue Doppler imaging peak systolic wave) and diastolic (left atrial diameter) assessment. Cognitive function was assessed and total and hippocampal brain volumes were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Global LV function was assessed by circulating N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. The role of potential mechanistic pathways of arterial stiffness, atherosclerosis, microvascular disease, and inflammation were explored. After adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, lower systolic function was associated with lower total brain (beta±standard error, 14.9±3.2 cm3; P{\textless}0.0001) and hippocampal volumes (0.05±0.02 cm3, P=0.01). Reduced diastolic function was associated with poorer working memory (-0.21±0.07, P=0.004) and fluency scores (-0.18±0.08, P=0.02). Reduced global LV function was associated with smaller hippocampal volume (-0.10±0.03 cm3, P=0.004) and adverse visual memory (-0.076±0.03, P=0.02) and processing speed (0.063±0.02, P=0.006) scores. Separate adjustment for concomitant cardiovascular risk factors attenuated associations with hippocampal volume and fluency only. Further adjustment for the alternative pathways of microvascular disease or arterial stiffness attenuated the relationship between global LV function and visual memory. CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based sample of older people, measures of LV function were associated with structural/functional measures of the brain. These associations were not wholly explained by concomitant risk factors or potential mechanistic pathways.},

Participants were included if they had no clinical diagnosis of dementia, had no gross brain structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging scans, and had received pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiovascular risk was measured at 5-year intervals across 5 phases from September 1991 to October 2013. Arterial spin labeling scans were acquired between April 2014 and December 2014. Data analysis was performed from June 2016 to September 2018. Exposures: Framingham Risk Score (FRS) for cardiovascular disease, comprising age, sex, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, total cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive medications, cigarette smoking, and diabetes, was assessed at 5 visits. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cerebral blood flow (CBF; in milliliters per 100 g of tissue per minute) was quantified with pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Of 116 adult participants, 99 (85.3{\%}) were men. At the first examination, mean (SD) age was 47.1 (5.0) years; at the last examination, mean (SD) age was 67.4 (4.9) years. Mean (SD) age at MRI scan was 69.3 (5.0) years. Log-FRS increased with time (B = 0.058; 95{\%} CI, 0.044 to 0.072; P {\textless}.001). Higher cumulative FRS over the 20-year period (measured as the integral of the rate of change of log-FRS) was associated with lower gray matter CBF (B = -0.513; 95{\%} CI -0.802 to -0.224; P {\textless}.001) after adjustment for age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, cognitive status, arterial transit time, use of statins, and weekly alcohol consumption. Voxelwise analyses revealed that this association was significant in 39.6{\%} of gray matter regions, including the posterior cingulate, precuneus, lateral parietal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampi, and parahippocampal gyrus. The strength of the association of higher log-FRS with lower CBF decreased progressively from the first examination (R2 = 0.253; B = -10.816; 99{\%} CI -18.375 to -3.257; P {\textless}.001) to the last (R2 = 0.188; B = -7.139; 99{\%} CI -14.861 to 0.582; P =.02), such that the most recent FRS measurement at mean (SD) age 67.4 (4.9) years was not significantly associated with CBF with a Bonferroni-corrected P {\textless}.01. Conclusions and Relevance: Cardiovascular risk in midlife was significantly associated with lower gray matter perfusion at older ages, but this association was not significant for cardiovascular risk in later life. This finding could inform the timing of cardiovascular interventions so as to be optimally effective.},

abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method to measure brain activity via changes in the degree of hemoglobin oxygenation through the intact skull. As optically measured hemoglobin signals strongly correlate with BOLD signals, simultaneous measurement using NIRS and fMRI promises a significant mutual enhancement of temporal and spatial resolutions. Although there exists a powerful statistical parametric mapping tool in fMRI, current public domain statistical tools for NIRS have several limitations related to the quantitative analysis of simultaneous recording studies with fMRI. In this paper, a new public domain statistical toolbox known as NIRS-SPM is described. It enables the quantitative analysis of NIRS signal. More specifically, NIRS data are statistically analyzed based on the general linear model (GLM) and Sun's tube formula. The p-values are calculated as the excursion probability of an inhomogeneous random field on a representation manifold that is dependent on the structure of the error covariance matrix and the interpolating kernels. NIRS-SPM not only enables the calculation of activation maps of oxy-, deoxy-hemoglobin and total hemoglobin, but also allows for the super-resolution localization, which is not possible using conventional analysis tools. Extensive experimental results using finger tapping and memory tasks confirm the viability of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Oxygen uptake (VO2) and skeletal muscle vastus lateralis fractional O2 extraction by near-infrared spectroscopy were assessed during incremental and low-intensity constant-work rate (CWR) exercises before (BEFORE) and at the end (AFTER) of training. VO2peak increased significantly with training both in MM ([x±SD] 14.7±1.2 mL.kg(-1)min(-1) vs. 17.6±1.4) and in McA (18.5±1.8 mL.kg(-1)min(-1) vs. 21.6±1.9). Peak skeletal muscle fractional O2 extraction increased with training both in MM (22.0±6.7 {\%} vs. 32.6±5.9) and in McA (18.5±6.2 {\%} vs. 37.2±7.2). During low-intensity CWR in both MM and McA: VO2 kinetics became faster in AFTER, but only in the patients with slow VO2 kinetics in BEFORE; the transient overshoot in fractional O2 extraction kinetics disappeared. The level of habitual physical activity was not higher 3 months after training (FOLLOW-UP vs. PRE). In MM and McA patients a home-based aerobic training program significantly attenuated the impairment of skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism and improved variables associated with exercise tolerance. Our findings indicate that in MM and McA patients NIRS and VO2 kinetics can effectively detect the functional improvements obtained by training.},

Methods We analysed a population-based prospective cohort of 30 528 middle-aged individuals (age 58±8 years; males, 40{\%}). Adjusted Cox regression models were applied to assess the impact of unexplained syncope/OH hospitalisations on cardiovascular events and mortality, excluding subjects with prevalent cardiovascular disease. Results After a median follow-up of 15±4 years, 524 (1.7{\%}) and 504 (1.7{\%}) participants were hospitalised for syncope or OH, respectively, yielding 1.2 hospital admissions per 1000 person-years for each diagnosis. Syncope hospitalisations increased with age (HR, per 1 year: 1.07, 95{\%} CI 1.05 to 1.09), higher systolic blood pressure (HR, per 10 mm Hg: 1.06, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.12), antihypertensive treatment (HR: 1.26, 95{\%} CI 1.00 to 1.59), use of diuretics (HR: 1.77, 95{\%} CI 1.31 to 2.38) and prevalent cardiovascular disease (HR: 1.59, 95{\%} CI 1.14 to 2.23), whereas OH hospitalisations increased with age (HR: 1.11, 95{\%} CI 1.08 to 1.12) and prevalent diabetes (HR: 1.82, 95{\%} CI 1.23 to 2.70). After exclusion of 1399 patients with prevalent cardiovascular disease, a total of 473/464 patients were hospitalised for unexplained syncope/OH before any cardiovascular event. Hospitalisation for unexplained syncope predicted coronary events (HR: 1.85, 95{\%} CI 1.49 to 2.30), heart failure (HR: 2.24, 95{\%} CI 1.65 to 3.04), atrial fibrillation (HR: 1.84, 95{\%} CI 1.50 to 2.26), aortic valve stenosis (HR: 2.06, 95{\%} CI 1.28 to 3.32), all-cause mortality (HR: 1.22, 95{\%} CI 1.09 to 1.37) and cardiovascular death (HR: 1.72, 95{\%} CI 1.23 to 2.42). OH-hospitalisation predicted stroke (HR: 1.66, 95{\%} CI 1.24 to 2.23), heart failure (HR: 1.78, 95{\%} CI 1.21 to 2.62), atrial fibrillation (HR: 1.89, 95{\%} CI 1.48 to 2.41) and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.14, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.30).

abstract = {Background Cerebrovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, coronary artery disease) and stroke can lead to vascular cognitive impairment. The Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis and Cognitive Function study evaluated the isolated impact of asymptomatic carotid stenosis (no prior ipsilateral or contralateral stroke or transient ischemic attack) on cognitive function. Cerebrovascular hemodynamic and carotid plaque characteristics were analyzed to elucidate potential mechanisms affecting cognition. Methods There were 82 patients with ≥50{\%} asymptomatic carotid stenosis and 62 controls without stenosis but matched for vascular comorbidities who underwent neurologic, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and comprehensive neuropsychological examination. Overall cognitive function and five domain-specific scores were computed. Duplex ultrasound with Doppler waveform and B-mode imaging defined the degree of stenosis, least luminal diameter, plaque area, and plaque gray-scale median. Breath-holding index (BHI) and microembolization were measured using transcranial Doppler. We assessed cognitive differences between stenosis patients and control patients and of stenosis patients with low vs high BHI and correlated cognitive function with microembolic counts and plaque characteristics. Results Stenosis and control patients did not differ in vascular risk factors, education, estimated intelligence, or depressive symptoms. Stenosis patients had worse composite cognitive scores (P =.02; Cohen's d = 0.43) and domain-specific scores for learning/memory (P =.02; d = 0.42) and motor/processing speed (P =.01; d = 0.65), whereas scores for executive function were numerically lower (P =.08). Approximately 49.4{\%} of all stenosis patients were impaired in at least two cognitive domains. Precisely 50{\%} of stenosis patients demonstrated a reduced BHI. Stenosis patients with reduced BHI performed worse on the overall composite cognitive score (t = −2.1; P =.02; d = 0.53) and tests for learning/memory (t = −2.7; P =.01; d = 0.66). Cognitive function did not correlate with measures of plaque burden (degree of stenosis, least luminal diameter, and plaque area) or with plaque gray-scale median. Conclusions Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is associated with cognitive impairment independent of known vascular risk factors for vascular cognitive impairment. Approximately 49.4{\%} of these patients demonstrate impairment in at least two neuropsychological domains. The deficit is driven primarily by reduced motor/processing speed and learning/memory and is mild to moderate in severity. The mechanism for impairment is likely to be hemodynamic as evidenced by reduced cerebrovascular reserve and the likely result of hypoperfusion from a pressure drop across the stenosis in the presence of inadequate collateralization.},

abstract = {SpineLab is a software tool developed for reconstructing neuronal feature skeletons from three- dimensional single- or multi-photon image stacks. These images often suffer from limited resolution and a low signal-to-noise ratio, making the extraction of morphometric information difficult. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a software tool that offers the possibility to create feature skeletons in various modes— automatically as well as with manual interaction. We have named this novel tool SpineLab. In a first step, an inves- tigator adjusts a set of parameters for automatic analysis in an interactive manner, i.e., with online visual feedback, followed by a second step, in which the neuronal feature skeleton can be modified by hand. We validate the ability of SpineLab to reconstruct the entire dendritic tree of identified GFP-expressing neurons and evaluate the accuracy of dendritic spine detection. We report that SpineLab is capable of significantly facilitating the reconstruction of dendrites and spines. Moreover, the automatic approach appears sufficient to detect spine density changes in time- lapse imaging experiments. Taken together, we conclude that SpineLab is an ideal software tool for partially auto- matic reconstruction of neural cell morphology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

abstract = {Several recent studies of aging and cognition have attributed decreases in the efficiency of working memory processes to possible declines in attentional control, the mechanism(s) by which the brain attempts to limit its processing to that of task-relevant information. Here we used fMRI measures of neural activity during performance of the color-word Stroop task to compare the neural substrates of attentional control in younger (ages: 21-27 years old) and older participants (ages: 60-75 years old) during conditions of both increased competition (incongruent and congruent neutral) and increased conflict (incongruent and congruent neutral). We found evidence of age-related decreases in the responsiveness of structures thought to support attentional control (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices), suggesting possible impairments in the implementation of attentional control in older participants. Consistent with this notion, older participants exhibited more extensive activation of ventral visual processing regions (i.e., temporal cortex) and anterior inferior prefrontal cortices, reflecting a decreased ability to inhibit the processing of task-irrelevant information. Also, the anterior cingulate cortex, a region involved in evaluatory processes at the level of response (e.g., detecting potential for error), showed age-related increases in its sensitivity to the presence of competing color information. These findings are discussed in terms of newly emerging models of attentional control in the human brain. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Design: Case-control diagnostic accuracy study. Setting: Academic dermatology department. Participants and Materials: Digital clinical images of pigmented cutaneous lesions (60 melanoma and 128 benign control lesions) with a histologic diagnosis rendered by a board-certified dermatopathologist, obtained before biopsy from patients undergoing lesion removal as a part of routine care. Main Outcome Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 4 smartphone applications designed to aid nonclinician users in determining whether their skin lesion is benign or malignant. Results: Sensitivity of the 4 tested applications ranged from 6.8{\%} to 98.1{\%}; specificity, 30.4{\%} to 93.7{\%}; positive predictive value, 33.3{\%} to 42.1{\%}; and negative predictive value, 65.4{\%} to 97.0{\%}. The highest sensitivity for melanoma diagnosis was observed for an application that sends the image directly to a board-certified dermatologist for analysis; the lowest, for applications that use automated algorithms to analyze images. Conclusions: The performance of smartphone applications in assessing melanoma risk is highly variable, and 3 of 4 smartphone applications incorrectly classified 30{\%} or more of melanomas as unconcerning.

abstract = {The augmentation index predicts cardiovascular mortality and is usually explained as a distally reflected wave adding to the forward wave generated by systole. We propose that the capacitative properties of the aorta (the arterial reservoir) also contribute significantly to the augmentation index and have calculated the contribution of the arterial reservoir, independently of wave reflection, and assessed how these contributions change with aging. In 15 subjects (aged 53 ± 10 yr), we measured pressure and Doppler velocity simultaneously in the proximal aorta using intra-arterial wires. We calculated the components of augmentation pressure in two ways: 1) into forward and backward (reflected) components by established separation methods, and 2) using an approach that accounts for an additional reservoir component. When the reservoir was ignored, augmentation pressure (22.7 ± 13.9 mmHg) comprised a small forward wave (peak pressure = 6.5 ± 9.4 mmHg) and a larger backward wave (peak pressure = 16.2 ± 7.6 mmHg). After we took account of the reservoir, the contribution to augmentation pressure of the backward wave was reduced by 64{\%} to 5.8 ± 4.4 mmHg (P {\textless} 0.001), forward pressure was negligible, and reservoir pressure was the largest component (peak pressure = 19.8 ± 9.3 mmHg). With age, reservoir pressure increased progressively (9.9 mmHg/decade, r = 0.69, P {\textless} 0.001). In conclusion, the augmentation index is principally determined by aortic reservoir function and other elastic arteries and only to a minor extent by reflected waves. Reservoir function rather than wave reflection changes markedly with aging, which accounts for the age-related changes in the aortic pressure waveform.

The present study examines FTT and GPT performance in a sample of 307 community-dwelling older individuals (ages 55-74) with no neurological or psychiatric history. Results: FTT performance was influenced by age, gender, and education, while GPT performance was influenced by age and gender. Findings are presented for both hands, as well as dominant-to-non-dominant hand ratio score, on each test. Correlations with other neuropsychological measures demonstrated that the GPT is more strongly correlated with measures of most domains (memory, processing speed, executive functioning, and spatial organization) than the FTT. Conclusions: While the FTT can be used to measure upper extremity motor ability, the GPT may be more strongly associated with general cognitive functioning in healthy adults. The FTT and GPT results presented will improve the utility of these tasks in clinical assessments of older adults.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was originally designed for clinical monitoring of tissue oxygenation, and it has also been developed into a useful tool in neuroimaging studies, with the so-called functional NIRS (fNIRS). With NIRS, cerebral activation is detected by measuring the cerebral hemoglobin (Hb), where however, the precise correlation between NIRS signal and neural activity remains to be fully understood. This can in part be attributed to the situation that NIRS signals are inherently subject to contamination by signals arising from extracerebral tissue. In recent years, several approaches have been investigated to distinguish between NIRS signals originating in cerebral tissue and signals originating in extracerebral tissue. Selective measurements of cerebral Hb will enable a further evolution of fNIRS. This chapter is divided into six sections: first a summary of the basic theory of NIRS, NIRS signals arising in the activated areas, correlations between NIRS signals and fMRI signals, correlations between NIRS signals and neural activities, and the influence of a variety of extracerebral tissue on NIRS signals and approaches to this issue are reviewed. Finally, future prospects of fNIRS are described. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Authors. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an optical imaging method that is used to noninvasively measure cerebral hemoglobin concentration changes induced by brain activation. Using structural guidance in fNIRS research enhances interpretation of results and facilitates making comparisons between studies. AtlasViewer is an open-source software package we have developed that incorporates multiple spatial registration tools to enable structural guidance in the interpretation of fNIRS studies. We introduce the reader to the layout of the AtlasViewer graphical user interface, the folder structure, and user files required in the creation of fNIRS probes containing sources and detectors registered to desired locations on the head, evaluating probe fabrication error and intersubject probe placement variability, and different procedures for estimating measurement sensitivity to different brain regions as well as image reconstruction performance. Further, we detail how AtlasViewer provides a generic head atlas for guiding interpretation of fNIRS results, but also permits users to provide subject-specific head anatomies to interpret their results. We anticipate that AtlasViewer will be a valuable tool in improving the anatomical interpretation of fNIRS studies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is currently one of the most promising tools in the neuroscientific research to study brain hemodynamics during naturalistic social communication. The application of fNIRS by studies in this field of knowledge has been widely justified by its strong resilience to motion artifacts, including those that might be generated by communicative head and facial movements. Previous studies have focused on the identification and correction of these artifacts, but a quantification of the differential contribution of common communicative movements on the quality of fNIRS signals is still missing. We assessed the impact of four movements (nodding head up and down, reading aloud, nodding head sideways, and raising eyebrows) performed during rest and task conditions on two metrics of signal quality control: an estimative of signal-to-noise performance and the negative correlation between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb). Channel-wise group analysis confirmed the robustness of the fNIRS technique to head nodding movements but showed a large effect of raising eyebrows in both signal quality control metrics, both during task and rest conditions. Reading aloud did not disrupt the expected anticorrelation between oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb but had a relatively large effect on signal-to-noise performance. These findings may have implications to the interpretation of fNIRS studies examining communicative processes.},

abstract = {The abilities to resolve flanker and Stroop interference, which are primarily mediated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), have been shown to be dissociable at the individual difference level. However, the relationship between the neurocognitive development of these two aspects of interference control remains unclear. This study examined developmental changes in inhibition performance and PFC activation during flanker and Stroop interference control using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-eight healthy children and adolescents aged 7–16 years (16 males) underwent the arrow flanker and color-word matching Stroop paradigms while changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration in the PFC were monitored by fNIRS. We found developmental improvements in inhibition performance in terms of the interference scores on both the flanker and Stroop tasks. There were also developmental increases in PFC activation, particularly in the medial region, while resolving flanker and Stroop interference. Despite developmental changes in inhibition performance and medial PFC activation during both tasks, the developmental changes that we observed for these two aspects of interference control were found to be relatively independent of each other. Our findings support the heterogeneous view of interference control and suggest that the neurocognitive development of flanker and Stroop interference control is only weakly associated, if not dissociable.},

However, identification of areas of cortical activation is a complex task due to intrinsic physiological noise and systemic interference and careful statistical analysis is therefore required. A total of 10 young healthy adults were studied. The activation paradigm comprised of anagrams followed by finger tapping. 12 channels of the OT system were positioned over the frontal cortex and 12 channels over the motor cortex while the systemic physiology (mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), scalp flux) was simultaneously monitored. Analysis was done using the functional Optical Signal Analysis (fOSA) software and Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM), where we utilized two approaches: (i) using only HbO(2) as a regressor in the general linear model (GLM) and (ii) using all of the explanatory variables (HbO(2), MBP, HR and scalp flux) as regressors. Group analysis using SPM showed significant correlation in a large number of OT channels between HbO(2) and systemic regressors; however no differences in activation areas were seen between the two approaches.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to evoked brain activity is reduced by physiological interference in at least two locations: 1. the superficial scalp and skull layers, and 2. in brain tissue itself. These interferences are generally termed as "global interferences" or "systemic interferences," and arise from cardiac activity, respiration, and other homeostatic processes. We present a novel method for global interference reduction and real-time recovery of evoked brain activity, based on the combination of a multiseparation probe configuration and adaptive filtering. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that this method can be effective in reducing the global interference and recovering otherwise obscured evoked brain activity. We also demonstrate that the physiological interference in the superficial layers is the major component of global interference. Thus, a measurement of superficial layer hemodynamics (e.g., using a short source-detector separation) makes a good reference in adaptive interference cancellation. The adaptive-filtering-based algorithm is shown to be resistant to errors in source-detector position information as well as to errors in the differential pathlength factor (DPF). The technique can be performed in real time, an important feature required for applications such as brain activity localization, biofeedback, and potential neuroprosthetic devices.},

abstract = {A number of systems have been proposed for classifying older adults who suffer from cognitive impairment or decline but do not yet meet criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The classification, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), has attracted much attention. It uses relatively specific diagnostic criteria and individuals who meet these criteria appear to be at substantial risk for the development of AD. However, little data is available to define the prevalence of MCI in any age group. We propose a simple mathematical model for the progression of patients from Non-Affected (NA) to MCI to AD. This first-order Markov model defines the likely prevalence of MCI at specific ages. Primary assumptions of the model include an AD prevalence of 1{\%} at age 60 increasing to 25{\%} at age 85 and a conversion rate from MCI to AD of 10{\%} constant across all ages considered. We used the best available information for our model and found (1) that the MCI prevalence increased from 1{\%} at age 60 to 42{\%} at age 85 and (2) that the conversion rate from NA to MCI increased from 1{\%} per year at age 60 to 11{\%} at age 85. In conclusion, this model allows estimation of prevalence of MCI and conversion from NA to MCI based upon known prevalences of AD, conversion rates of MCI to AD, and death rates. Due to its substantial prevalence, MCI may be an important target for screening and possible intervention. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 .},

abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method to measure brain activity via changes in the degree of hemoglobin oxygenation through the intact skull. As optically measured hemoglobin signals strongly correlate with BOLD signals, simultaneous measurement using NIRS and fMRI promises a significant mutual enhancement of temporal and spatial resolutions. Although there exists a powerful statistical parametric mapping tool in fMRI, current public domain statistical tools for NIRS have several limitations related to the quantitative analysis of simultaneous recording studies with fMRI. In this paper, a new public domain statistical toolbox known as NIRS-SPM is described. It enables the quantitative analysis of NIRS signal. More specifically, NIRS data are statistically analyzed based on the general linear model (GLM) and Sun's tube formula. The p-values are calculated as the excursion probability of an inhomogeneous random field on a representation manifold that is dependent on the structure of the error covariance matrix and the interpolating kernels. NIRS-SPM not only enables the calculation of activation maps of oxy-, deoxy-hemoglobin and total hemoglobin, but also allows for the super-resolution localization, which is not possible using conventional analysis tools. Extensive experimental results using finger tapping and memory tasks confirm the viability of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The apolipoprotein-E genotype has been associated with Alzheimer's disease, and we postulate that it plays a part, together with atherosclerosis, in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the frequency of dementia and its subtypes in relation to atherosclerosis and apolipoprotein E. Methods. We did a population-based study of 284 patients with dementia, 207 of whom had Alzheimer's disease, and 1698 individuals who were not demented. indicators of atherosclerosis included vessel wall thickness and plaques of the carotid arteries, assessed by ultrasonography, and the ratio of ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure as a measure of generalised atherosclerosis. Based on these indicators participants were scored from 0 (no atherosclerosis) to 3 (severe atherosclerosis) for degree of atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein-E polymorphisms were assessed in 246 patients and in 928 controls. Findings. All indicators of atherosclerosis were associated with dementia (odds ratios ranging from 1.3 to 1.9) and its major subtypes Alzheimer's disease (odds ratios 1.3-1.8) and vascular dementia (odds ratios 1.9-3.2). The frequencies of all dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia increased with the degree of atherosclerosis. The odds ratio for Alzheimer's disease in those with severe atherosclerosis compared with those without atherosclerosis was 3.0 (95{\%} CI 1.5-6.0; p = 0.001). In participants with the apolipoprotein-E $\epsilon$4 genotype and an atherosclerosis score of 2 or 3 the odds ratio for all dementia was 4.5 (2.0-10.1; p {\textless} 0.001), for Alzheimer's disease was 3.9 (1.6-9.6; p = 0.002), and for vascular dementia was 19.8 (4.1-95.0; p {\textless} 0.001). Interpretation. These findings suggest that dementia and its two major subtypes Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are associated with atherosclerosis and that there is an interaction between apolipoprotein E and atherosclerosis in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is susceptible to signal artifacts caused by relative motion between NIRS optical fibers and the scalp. These artifacts can be very damaging to the utility of functional NIRS, particularly in challenging subject groups where motion can be unavoidable. A number of approaches to the removal of motion artifacts from NIRS data have been suggested. In this paper we systematically compare the utility of a variety of published NIRS motion correction techniques using a simulated functional activation signal added to 20 real NIRS datasets which contain motion artifacts. Principle component analysis, spline interpolation, wavelet analysis, and Kalman filtering approaches are compared to one another and to standard approaches using the accuracy of the recovered, simulated hemodynamic response function (HRF). Each of the four motion correction techniques we tested yields a significant reduction in the mean-squared error (MSE) and significant increase in the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the recovered HRF when compared to no correction and compared to a process of rejecting motion-contaminated trials. Spline interpolation produces the largest average reduction in MSE (55{\%}) while wavelet analysis produces the highest average increase in CNR (39{\%}). On the basis of this analysis, we recommend the routine application of motion correction techniques (particularly spline interpolation or wavelet analysis) to minimize the impact of motion artifacts on functional NIRS data.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The implementation of motion management techniques in radiation therapy  can aid in mitigating uncertainties and reducing margins. For motion management to be effective, it is necessary to track key structures both accurately and at a real-time speed. Therefore, the focus of this work was to develop a 2D algorithm for the real-time tracking of ultrasound features to aid in radiation therapy motion management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The developed algorithm utilized a similarity measure-based block matching algorithm incorporating training methods and multiple simultaneous templates. The algorithm is broken down into three primary components, all of which use normalized cross-correlation (NCC) as a similarity metric. First, a global feature shift to account for gross displacements from the previous frame is determined using large block sizes which encompass the entirety of the feature. Second, the most similar reference frame is chosen from a series of training images that are accumulated during the first K frames of tracking to aid in contour consistency and provide a starting point for the localized template initialization. Finally, localized block matching is performed through the simultaneous use of both a training frame and the previous frame. The localized block matching utilizes a series of templates positioned at the boundary points of the training and previous contours. The weighted final boundary points from both the previous and the training frame are ultimately combined and used to determine an affine transformation from the previous frame to the current frame. RESULTS: A mean tracking error of 0.72 +/- 1.25 mm was observed for 85 point-landmarks across 39 ultrasound sequences relative to manual ground truth annotations. The image processing speed per landmark with the GPU implementation was between 41 and 165 frames per second (fps) during the training set accumulation, and between 73 and 234 fps after training set accumulation. Relative to a comparable multithreaded CPU approach using OpenMP, the GPU implementation resulted in speedups between -30{\%} and 355{\%} during training set accumulation, and between -37{\%} and 639{\%} postaccumulation. CONCLUSIONS: Initial implementations indicated an accuracy that was comparable to or exceeding those achieved by alternative 2D tracking methods, with a computational speed that is more than sufficient for real-time applications in a radiation therapy environment. While the overall performance reached levels suitable for implementation in radiation therapy, the observed increase in failures for smaller features, as well as the algorithm's inability to be applied to nonconvex features warrants additional investigation to address the shortcomings observed.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique evaluating microvascular function. The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility of NIRS parameters during reactive hyperemia induced by a 5 min brachial artery occlusion. Twenty-four healthy young males (mean 34 ± 8 years old) had two microvascular function evaluations by NIRS over a 7 to 30-day period (mean 16 ± 10 days). Intra-subject and inter-observer reproducibility were evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), and standard error of measurement (SEM{\%}) for every parameter. Mean NIRS parameters did not differ between both evaluations. Reproducibility was greatest for muscle oxygen consumption (ICC: 0.84; CV: 6.51{\%}; SEM: 7.11{\%}), time to basal O(2)Hb (ICC: 0.63, CV: 20.04{\%}, SEM 27.22{\%}), time to maximal O(2)Hb (ICC: 0.71; CV: 15.61{\%}; SEM: 19.27{\%}), peak of O(2)Hb (ICC: 0.63, CV: 6.68{\%}, SEM 8.53{\%}), time to maximal tHb (ICC: 0.73, CV: 19,61{\%}, SEM 24.56{\%}) and area under the O(2)Hb and tHb curves (ICC: 0.68, CV: 16.15{\%}, SEM 22.93{\%} and ICC: 0.62, CV: 18.59{\%}, SEM 26.64{\%}, respectively). Moreover, inter-observer reproducibility ranged from excellent to perfect (ICC from 0.85 to 1.00) for every parameter. NIRS parameters during reactive hyperemia are highly reproducible which enables their repeated measurement to study microvascular function in healthy subjects.},

abstract = {Microinfarctions are present in the aged and injured human brain. Their clinical relevance is controversial, with postulated sequelae ranging from cognitive sparing to vascular dementia. To address the consequences of microinfarcts, we used controlled optical methods to create occlusions of individual penetrating arterioles or venules in rat cortex. Single microinfarcts, targeted to encompass all or part of a cortical column, impaired performance in a macrovibrissa-based behavioral task. Furthermore, the targeting of multiple vessels resulted in tissue damage that coalesced across cortex, even though the intervening penetrating vessels were acutely patent. Post-occlusion administration of memantine, a glutamate receptor antagonist that reduces cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, ameliorated tissue damage and perceptual deficits. Collectively, these data imply that microinfarcts likely contribute to cognitive decline. Strategies that have received limited success in the treatment of ischemic injury, which include therapeutics against excitotoxicity, may be successful against the progressive nature of vascular dementia. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Preclinical studies provide strong evidence that age-related impairment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). NVC is a critical homeostatic mechanism in the brain, responsible for adjustment of local cerebral blood flow to the energetic needs of the active neuronal tissue. Recent progress in geroscience has led to the identification of critical cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in neurovascular aging, identifying these pathways as targets for intervention. In order to translate the preclinical findings to humans, there is a need to assess NVC in geriatric patients as an endpoint in clinical studies. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that enables the investigation of local changes in cerebral blood flow, quantifying task-related changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations. In the present overview, the basic principles of fNIRS are introduced and the application of this technique to assess NVC in older adults with implications for the design of studies on the mechanistic underpinnings of VCI is discussed.},

abstract = {Brain imaging studies have reported age-related differences in brain activation for attentional control functions, such as inhibition and task-switching. However, age-related differences in brain activation patterns in more than one attentional control task have rarely been studied in the same group of participants. In this study, younger and older adults completed a modified Stroop task with interference and switching conditions, using functional near infra-red spectroscopy. While interference did not reveal any significant activation of the prefrontal cortex in younger adults, switching produced an increased activation bilaterally in both the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). In older adults, an isolated right and left anterior DLPFC activation was observed even in the non-executive conditions of the Stroop task (color denomination) and the interference condition revealed activation mostly in the posterior left DLPFC and bilateral VLPFC with a small right anterior DLPFC component. Specific to older adults, switching induced an increased activation spread out bilaterally over the prefrontal cortex in the bilateral anterior DLPFC, the posterior left DLPFC and bilateral VLPFC. These results suggest that for both older and younger adults, inhibition and switching are associated with distinct patterns of prefrontal activation and that age-related differences exist in these patterns such that prefrontal activation seems to be more spread out at different sites in older adults. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is the result of the deposition of an amyloidogenic protein in cortical and leptomeningeal vessels. The most common type of CAA is caused by amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$), which is particularly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Excessive A$\beta$-CAA formation can be caused by several mutations in the A$\beta$ precursor protein and presenilin genes. The origin of A$\beta$ in CAA is likely to be neuronal, although cerebrovascular cells or the circulation cannot be excluded as a source. Despite the apparent similarity, the pathogenesis of CAA appears to differ from that of senile plaques in several aspects, including the mechanism of A$\beta$-induced cellular toxicity, the extent of inflammatory reaction and the role of oxidative stress. Therefore, therapeutic strategies for AD should, at least in part, also target CAA. Moreover, CAA and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) may set a lower threshold for AD-like changes to cause dementia and may even cause dementia on its own, since patients with AD and CAA and/or CVD appear to be more cognitively impaired than patients with only AD. In conclusion, the precise impact of CAA on AD or dementia remains unclear, however, its role may have been underestimated in the past, and more extensive studies of in vitro and in vivo models for CAA will be needed to elucidate the importance of CAA-specific approaches in designing intervention strategies for AD. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding the properties of attentional control, along with the neural mechanisms subserving them, has long invited intense scrutiny in research groups. However, it has not been demonstrated how the top-down anticipatory hemodynamic activation influences the subsequent attentional processing of targets and distractors. Here, with concurrent fNIRS-ERP recording, we explored the potential contribution of anticipatory oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) based brain activity to attentional control by examining how HbO influences the subsequent ERP N2pc components assumed to reflect attentional selection. We found that expecting a target led to a larger increase of preparatory HbO response over the visual cortex contralateral to the upcoming target, which was positively correlated with the subsequent target-evoked N2pc amplitude. Further, anticipation concerning the presence of a competing distractor resulted in large and prolonged preparatory HbO signals in the visual cortex contralateral to the distractor, indicating that the salient distractor might be actively suppressed by preparatory top-down attentional control. However, the pre-suppressed distractor still captured part of the attention in the subsequent visual search as revealed by a decrease in the N2pc amplitude, and such a distraction effect on N2pc was negatively correlated with preparatory HbO enhancement contralateral to the anticipated distractor. Overall, each individuals attentional shift to the target and resistance to the distractor measured by ERP is predictable in advance via anticipatory hemodynamic activity in the visual cortex measured by fNIRS.},

The differences in cognitive profile and clinical progression among individuals with MCI are generally recognised. However, recent evidence also suggests that the aetiological heterogeneity among individuals with MCI could be greater than previously reported. For example, cerebrovascular disease seems to be underestimated as a potential cause of MCI. In this review, I attempt to recognise workable definitions of MCI to discuss the prevalence, pathophysiology, prognosis, and possibilities for treatment of this disorder.},

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique that uses low levels of light to measure changes in cerebral blood oxygenation levels. In the majority of NIRS functional brain studies, analysis of this data is based on a statistical comparison of hemodynamic levels between a baseline and task or between multiple task conditions by means of a linear regression model: the so-called general linear model. Although these methods are similar to their implementation in other fields, particularly for functional magnetic resonance imaging, the specific application of these methods in fNIRS research differs in several key ways related to the sources of noise and artifacts unique to fNIRS. In this brief communication, we discuss the application of linear regression models in fNIRS and the modifications needed to generalize these models in order to deal with structured (colored) noise due to systemic physiology and noise heteroscedasticity due to motion artifacts. The objective of this work is to present an overview of these noise properties in the context of the linear model as it applies to fNIRS data. This work is aimed at explaining these mathematical issues to the general fNIRS experimental researcher but is not intended to be a complete mathematical treatment of these concepts.},

abstract = {Objectives: Prevention of cognitive decline and dementia with blood pressure lowering treatments has shown inconsistent results. We compared the effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on the incidence of dementia, and on cognitive function. METHODS:: We conducted a systematic review and included 19 randomized trials (18 515 individuals) and 11 studies (831 674 individuals) analysing the effects of antihypertensive treatment on cognition and on the incidence of dementia, respectively, in hypertensive patients without prior cerebrovascular disorders. Network meta-analysis was used for the comparison of antihypertensive classes. Results: Antihypertensive treatment, regardless of the drug class, had benefits on overall cognition [effect size 0.05, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.07] and all cognitive functions except language. Antihypertensive treatment reduced the risk of all-cause dementia by 9{\%}, with reference to the control group (hazard ratio 0.91, 95{\%} CI 0.89-0.94), when randomized trials and observationnal studies were combined (n = 15). Result was not significant with randomized trials alone (n = 4). Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) had larger benefits than placebo on overall cognition (adjusted effect size 0.60 ± 0.18, P = 0.02). ARBs were more effective than $\beta$-blockers (0.67 ± 0.18, P = 0.01), diuretics (0.54 ± 0.19, P = 0.04) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (0.47 ± 0.17, P = 0.04) in rank. The mean change in blood pressure did not differ significantly between the different antihypertensive drug classes. Conclusion: Our results support the notion that antihypertensive treatment has beneficial effects on cognitive decline and prevention of dementia, and indicate that these effects may differ between drug classes with ARBs possibly being the most effective. {\textcopyright} 2013 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive method to measure brain activities using the changes of optical absorption in the brain through the intact skull. fNIRS has many advantages over other neuroimaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or magnetoencephalography (MEG), since it can directly measure blood oxygenation level changes related to neural activation with high temporal resolution. However, fNIRS signals are highly corrupted by measurement noises and physiology-based systemic interference. Careful statistical analyses are therefore required to extract neuronal activity-related signals from fNIRS data. In this paper, we provide an extensive review of historical developments of statistical analyses of fNIRS signal, which include motion artifact correction, short source-detector separation correction, principal component analysis (PCA)/independent component analysis (ICA), false discovery rate (FDR), serially-correlated errors, as well as inference techniques such as the standard t-test, F-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and statistical parameter mapping (SPM) framework. In addition, to provide a unified view of various existing inference techniques, we explain a linear mixed effect model with restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) variance estimation, and show that most of the existing inference methods for fNIRS analysis can be derived as special cases. Some of the open issues in statistical analysis are also described. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Several two-layer Monte Carlo simulations of NIRS time series were generated using a physiologically relevant range of optical properties and varying the absorption coefficients due to bottom-layer, top-layer, and/or global fluctuations. Initial results showed that by measuring absorption trends at two source-detector separations and performing a least-squares fit of one to the other, processed signals strongly resemble the simulated bottom-layer absorption properties. Through this approach, it was demonstrated that fitting coefficients can be estimated within less than +/- 2{\%} of the ideal value without any a priori knowledge of the optical properties present in the model. An analytical approximation for the least-squares coefficient provides physical insight into the nature of errors and suggests ways to reduce them.},

abstract = {Background and aims: Common mechanisms for the development of micro- and macroangiopathic diabetic complications have been suggested. We aimed to cross-sectionally investigate strength and characteristics of the association between carotid atherosclerosis and microangiopathy in type 2 diabetic patients. Methods and results: Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT), carotid plaque (CP) type and degree of stenosis were evaluated by ultrasound, along with the determination of anthropometric parameters, HbA1c, lipid profile, assessment of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, in 662 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients were divided according to high/low cIMT, presence/absence of CP and of retinopathy and nephropathy. Patients with CP were older, more prevalently males, past smokers, had longer diabetes duration, significantly lower HDL cholesterol and more prevalent ischemic heart disease (all p{\textless} 0.05) as compared to those with cIMT {\textless} 1. mm. Microangiopathies were more prevalent in patients with CP than in those without. At multivariate logistic regression, factors independently associated with the presence of CP were age, past smoke, HDL cholesterol, retinopathy and retinopathy plus nephropathy. A significant independent correlation of CP stenosis with stage of retinopathy and nephropathy was found. Finally, echolucent CPs were associated with a lower prevalence of proliferative retinopathy than CP containing calcium deposits. Conclusion: In T2DM, retinopathy, alone or in combination with nephropathy, is independently associated to CP, and severity of microangiopathy correlates with severity of carotid atherosclerosis. These observations, together with the different prevalence of proliferative retinopathy according to CP types, point to possible common pathogenic mechanisms in micro- and macrovascular complications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In medical near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), movements of the subject often cause large step changes in the baselines of the measured light attenuation signals. This prevents comparison of hemoglobin concentration levels before and after movement. We present an accelerometer-based motion artifact removal (ABAMAR) algorithm for correcting such baseline motion artifacts (BMAs). ABAMAR can be easily adapted to various long-term monitoring applications of NIRS. We applied ABAMAR to NIRS data collected in 23 all-night sleep measurements and containing BMAs from involuntary movements during sleep. For reference, three NIRS researchers independently identified BMAs from the data. To determine whether the use of an accelerometer improves BMA detection accuracy, we compared ABAMAR to motion detection based on peaks in the moving standard deviation (SD) of NIRS data. The number of BMAs identified by ABAMAR was similar to the number detected by the humans, and 79 of the artifacts identified by ABAMAR were confirmed by at least two humans. While the moving SD of NIRS data could also be used for motion detection, on average 2 out of the 10 largest SD peaks in NIRS data each night occurred without the presence of movement. Thus, using an accelerometer improves BMA detection accuracy in NIRS. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

abstract = {Objective: To show the clinical relevance of post-prandial hypotension and to review its pathophysiology and management. Data Sources: Articles on postprandial hypotension were identified through MEDLINE and bibliographies of relevant articles. Study Selection: All articles and case reports describing meal-related hypotension in the elderly and in patients with autonomic failure. Data Synthesis: Postprandial hypotension, defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more, may result in syncope, falls, dizziness, weakness, angina pectoris, and stroke. Postprandial hypotension is distinct from and probably more common than orthostatic hypotension. Because meal-related hypotension is particularly common in older hypertensive patients, it has important implications for the evaluation and management of hypertension. The mechanism of postprandial hypotension is not fully understood. Possible contributors include inadequate sympathetic nervous system compensation for meal-induced splanchnic blood pooling; impairments in baroreflex function; inadequate postprandial increases in cardiac output; and impaired peripheral vasoconstriction, insulin-induced vasodilation, and release of vasodilatory gastrointestinal peptides. Although caffeine is often recommended as treatment for postprandial hypotension, available data do not support its use. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, has been shown to be effective, but it is expensive and must be given parenterally. Conclusion: All physicians caring for elderly patients should be aware of the hypotensive effects of food intake and should consider postprandial hypotension in the evaluation of syncope, falls, dizziness, and other cerebral ischemic symptoms.},

abstract = {This paper concerns temporal filtering in fMRI time-series analysis. Whitening serially correlated data is the most efficient approach to parameter estimation. However, if there is a discrepancy between the assumed and the actual correlations, whitening can render the analysis exquisitely sensitive to bias when estimating the standard error of the ensuing parameter estimates. This bias, although not expressed in terms of the estimated responses, has profound effects on any statistic used for inference. The special constraints of fMRI analysis ensure that there will always be a misspecification of the assumed serial correlations. One resolution of this problem is to filter the data to minimize bias, while maintaining a reasonable degree of efficiency. In this paper we present expressions for efficiency (of parameter estimation) and bias (in estimating standard error) in terms of assumed and actual correlation structures in the context of the general linear model. We show that: (i) Whitening strategies can result in profound bias and are therefore probably precluded in parametric fMRI data analyses. (ii) Band-pass filtering, and implicitly smoothing, has an important role in protecting against inferential bias. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is a critical process for the maintenance of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. Assessment of CA is frequently used for experimental research and in the diagnosis, monitoring, or prognosis of cerebrovascular disease; however, despite the extensive use and reference to static CA, a valid quantification of "normal" CA has not been clearly identified. While controlling for the influence of arterial Pco(2), we provide the first clear examination of static CA in healthy humans over a wide range of blood pressure. In 11 healthy humans, beat-to-beat blood pressure (radial arterial), middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv; transcranial Doppler ultrasound), end-tidal Pco(2), and cerebral oxygenation (near infrared spectroscopy) were recorded continuously during pharmacological-induced changes in mean blood pressure. In a randomized order, steady-state decreases and increases in mean blood pressure (8 to 14 levels; range: approximately 40 to approximately 125 mm Hg) were achieved using intravenous infusions of sodium nitroprusside or phenylephrine, respectively. MCAv(mean) was altered by 0.82+/-0.35{\%} per millimeter of mercury change in mean blood pressure (R(2)=0.82). Changes in cortical oxygenation index were inversely related to changes in mean blood pressure (slope=-0.18{\%}/mm Hg; R(2)=0.60) and MCAv(mean) (slope=-0.26{\%}/cm . s(-1); R(2)=0.54). There was a progressive increase in MCAv pulsatility with hypotension. These findings indicate that cerebral blood flow closely follows pharmacological-induced changes in blood pressure in otherwise healthy humans. Thus, a finite slope of the plateau region does not necessarily imply a defective CA. Moreover, with progressive hypotension and hypertension there are differential changes in cerebral oxygenation and MCAv(mean).},

As the vast majority of commercial instruments developed until now are based on continuous wave technology, the aim of this publication is to review the current state of instrumentation and methodology of continuous wave fNIRI. For this purpose we provide an overview of the commercially available instruments and address instrumental aspects such as light sources, detectors and sensor arrangements. Methodological aspects, algorithms to calculate the concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and approaches for data analysis are also reviewed.From the single-location measurements of the early years, instrumentation has progressed to imaging initially in two dimensions (topography) and then three (tomography). The methods of analysis have also changed tremendously, from the simple modified Beer-Lambert law to sophisticated image reconstruction and data analysis methods used today. Due to these advances, fNIRI has become a modality that is widely used in neuroscience research and several manufacturers provide commercial instrumentation. It seems likely that fNIRI will become a clinical tool in the foreseeable future, which will enable diagnosis in single subjects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Newborns with critical health conditions are monitored in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). In NICU, one of the most important problems that they face is the risk of brain injury. There is a need for continuous monitoring of newborn's brain function to prevent any potential brain injury. This type of monitoring should not interfere with intensive care of the newborn. Therefore, it should be non-invasive and portable. METHODS: In this paper, a low-cost, battery operated, dual wavelength, continuous wave near infrared spectroscopy system for continuous bedside hemodynamic monitoring of neonatal brain is presented. The system has been designed to optimize SNR by optimizing the wavelength-multiplexing parameters with special emphasis on safety issues concerning burn injuries. SNR improvement by utilizing the entire dynamic range has been satisfied with modifications in analog circuitry. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: As a result, a shot-limited SNR of 67 dB has been achieved for 10 Hz temporal resolution. The system can operate more than 30 hours without recharging when an off-the-shelf 1850 mAh-7.2 V battery is used. Laboratory tests with optical phantoms and preliminary data recorded in NICU demonstrate the potential of the system as a reliable clinical tool to be employed in the bedside regional monitoring of newborn brain metabolism under intensive care.},

abstract = {Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) allows the recovery of cortical oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin changes associated with evoked brain activity. NIRS is a back-reflection measurement making it very sensitive to the superficial layers of the head, i.e. the skin and the skull, where systemic interference occurs. As a result, the NIRS signal is strongly contaminated with systemic interference of superficial origin. A recent approach to overcome this problem has been the use of additional short source-detector separation optodes as regressors. Since these additional measurements are mainly sensitive to superficial layers in adult humans, they can be used to remove the systemic interference present in longer separation measurements, improving the recovery of the cortical hemodynamic response function (HRF). One question that remains to answer is whether or not a short separation measurement is required in close proximity to each long separation NIRS channel. Here, we show that the systemic interference occurring in the superficial layers of the human head is inhomogeneous across the surface of the scalp. As a result, the improvement obtained by using a short separation optode decreases as the relative distance between the short and the long measurement is increased. NIRS data was acquired on 6 human subjects both at rest and during a motor task consisting of finger tapping. The effect of distance between the short and the long channel was first quantified by recovering a synthetic hemodynamic response added over the resting-state data. The effect was also observed in the functional data collected during the finger tapping task. Together, these results suggest that the short separation measurement must be located as close as 1.5. cm from the standard NIRS channel in order to provide an improvement which is of practical use. In this case, the improvement in Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) compared to a standard General Linear Model (GLM) procedure without using any small separation optode reached 50{\%} for HbO and 100{\%} for HbR. Using small separations located farther than 2. cm away resulted in mild or negligible improvements only. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with cognitive deficits even in the absence of stroke. We examined the relationship between cardiac performance, as measured by cardiac output (CO) and ejection fraction (EF), and brain activity during a verbal working memory (VWM) task in elderly CVD patients who tend to be at increased risk for vascular cognitive impairments. Seventeen patients were recruited from a cohort participating in an ongoing prospective study examining the effects of CVD on cognitive function in the elderly. Participants were diagnosed with CVD (age 68±8) and completed a 2-back VWM task in a 1.5T fMRI paradigm. CO and EF were calculated from echocardiogram measures. Task-related activation was averaged in a priori regions of interest. The relationship between CO, EF, and 2-back-related activity was modeled using partial correlations (two-tailed p{\textless}.05) controlling for age and 2-back accuracy. All participants were globally cognitively intact as indicated by Mini-Mental Status Exam and Dementia Rating Scale scores. Mean accuracy on the 2-back was 78±9{\%} while reaction time averaged 1,027±192 ms. Mean CO and EF values showed a large range (CO: 3.55 to 6.31; EF: 0.36 to 0.76) but average values were within the normal range. After controlling for age and 2-back accuracy, lower EF was related to decrease in left insula activity (r=0.61, p=0.03). There were trends for EF to be related to accuracy (r=0.47, p=0.09) and reaction time (r=-0.48, p=0.09). CO was also related to insula activity (r=0.60, p=0.04) and activity in the supplementary motor area activity (r=0.66, p=0.01). Cardiac performance was related to decreased efficiency in task related brain areas and tended to be related to performance on a VWM task in elderly patients with CVD. Results have implications for a line of investigation indicating that cardiac and systemic vascular indices could be used as proxy measures to examine mechanisms of cerebrovascular dysfunction in the elderly. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.},

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive imaging approach for measuring brain activities based on changes in the cerebral concentrations of hemoglobin. Recently, statistical analysis based on a general linear model (GLM) has become popular. Here, to impose statistical significance on the activation detected by fNIRS, family-wise error (FWE) rate control is important. However, unlike fMRI, in which measurements are densely sampled on a regular lattice and Gaussian smoothing makes the resulting random field homogeneous, the random fields from fNIRS are inhomogeneous due to the interpolation from sparsely and irregularly distributed optode locations. Thus, tube formula based correction has been proposed to address this issue. However, Sun's tube formula cannot be used for general random fields such as F-statistics. To overcome these difficulties, we employ the expected Euler characteristic approach based on Lipschitz-Killing curvature (LKC) to control the family-wise error rate. We compared this correction method with Sun's tube formula for t-statistics to confirm the existing method. Based on this comparison, we show that covariance estimation should be modified to consider channel-wise least-square residual correlation. These new results supplement the existing tool of statistical parameter mapping for fNIRS. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Small-vessel disease or cerebral microangiopathy is a common finding in elderly people leading finally to subcortical ischemic vascular dementia. Because cerebral microangiopathy impairs vascular reactivity and affects mainly the frontal lobes, we hypothesized that brain activation decreases during an event-related color-word matching Stroop task. 12 patients suffering from cerebral microangiopathy were compared with 12 age-matched controls. As an imaging method we applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy, because it is particularly sensitive to the microvasculature. The Stroop task led to activations in the lateral prefrontal cortex. Generally, the amplitude of the hemodynamic response was reduced in patients in tight correlation with behavioral slowing during the Stroop task and with neuropsychological deficits, namely attentional and executive dysfunction. Interestingly, patients showed an early deoxygenation of blood right after stimulation onset, and a delay of the hemodynamic response. Whereas the amplitude of the hemodynamic response is reduced in the frontal lobes also with normal aging, data suggest that impairments of neurovascular coupling are specific for cerebral microangiopathy. In summary, our findings indicate frontal dysfunction and impairments of neurovascular coupling in cerebral microangiopathy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It has been impossible, however, to study the relationship between atherosclerosis and $\beta$-amyloidosis; in those models because such mice were on atherosclerosis-resistant genetic backgrounds. Here we report the establishment of AD model mice, B6Tg2576, that are prone to atherosclerosis. B6Tg2576 mice were produced by back-crossing Tg2576 mice, an AD mouse model overexpressing human amyloid $\beta$-protein precursor with the Swedish double mutation, to C57BL/6 mice, a strain susceptible to diet-induced atherosclerosis. An atherogenic diet induced aortic atherosclerosis and exacerbated cerebral $\beta$-amyloidosis in B6Tg2576 mice. Compared with age-matched non-transgenic littermates, B6Tg2576 mice developed significantly more diet-induced aortic atherosclerosis. Unexpectedly, normal diet-fed B6Tg2576 mice also developed fatty streak lesions (early atherosclerosis) in the aorta. The aortic atherosclerotic lesion area positively correlated with cerebral $\beta$-amyloid deposits in B6Tg2576 mice on both atherogenic and normal diets. Furthermore, behavioral assessments demonstrated that B6Tg2576 mice fed an atherogenic diet had more spatial learning impairment than those fed a normal diet.

abstract = {The Stroop interference task requires a person to respond to a specific dimension of a stimulus while suppressing a competing stimulus dimension. Previous PET and fMRI studies using the Color Stroop paradigm have shown increased activity in the "cognitive division" of the cingulate cortex. In our fMRI study with nine subjects, we used a Color-Word Matching Stroop task. A frontoparietal network, including structures in the lateral prefrontal cortex, the frontopolar region, the intraparietal sulcus, as well as the lateral occipitotemporal gyrus, was activated when contrasting the incongruent vs the neutral condition. However, no substantial activation in either the right or left hemisphere of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was detected. In accordance with a series of recent articles, we argue that the ACC is not specifically involved in interference processes. The ACC seems rather involved in motor preparation processes which were controlled in the present Color-Word Matching Stroop task. We argue that the region around the banks of the inferior frontal sulcus is required to solve interference problems, a concept which can also be seen as a component of task set management. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Recent technological advances have allowed the development of portable functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) devices that can be used to perform neuroimaging in the real-world. However, as real-world experiments are designed to mimic everyday life situations, the identification of event onsets can be extremely challenging and time-consuming. Here, we present a novel analysis method based on the general linear model (GLM) least square fit analysis for the Automatic IDentification of functional Events (or AIDE) directly from real-world fNIRS neuroimaging data. In order to investigate the accuracy and feasibility of this method, as a proof-of-principle we applied the algorithm to (i) synthetic fNIRS data simulating both block-, event-related and mixed-design experiments and (ii) experimental fNIRS data recorded during a conventional lab-based task (involving maths). AIDE was able to recover functional events from simulated fNIRS data with an accuracy of 89{\%}, 97{\%} and 91{\%} for the simulated block-, event-related and mixed-design experiments respectively. For the lab-based experiment, AIDE recovered more than the 66.7{\%} of the functional events from the fNIRS experimental measured data. To illustrate the strength of this method, we then applied AIDE to fNIRS data recorded by a wearable system on one participant during a complex real-world prospective memory experiment conducted outside the lab. As part of the experiment, there were four and six events (actions where participants had to interact with a target) for the two different conditions respectively (condition 1: social-interact with a person; condition 2: non-social-interact with an object). AIDE managed to recover 3/4 events and 3/6 events for conditions 1 and 2 respectively. The identified functional events were then corresponded to behavioural data from the video recordings of the movements and actions of the participant. Our results suggest that “brain-first” rather than “behaviour-first” analysis is possible and that the present method can provide a novel solution to analyse real-world fNIRS data, filling the gap between real-life testing and functional neuroimaging.},

The aim of the present work is to verify the theoretical adequacy of the various scoring methods used to measure the Stroop effect. We present a systematic review of studies that have provided normative data for the SCWT. We referred to both electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar) and citations. Our findings show that while several scoring methods have been reported in literature, none of the reviewed methods enables us to fully assess the Stroop effect. Furthermore, we discuss several normative scoring methods from the Italian panorama as reported in literature. We claim for an alternative scoring method which takes into consideration both speed and accuracy of the response. Finally, we underline the importance of assessing the performance in all Stroop Test conditions (word reading, color naming, named color-word).},

This prevents comparison of hemoglobin concentration levels before and after movement. We present an accelerometer-based motion artifact removal (ABAMAR) algorithm for correcting such baseline motion artifacts (BMAs). ABAMAR can be easily adapted to various long-term monitoring applications of NIRS. We applied ABAMAR to NIRS data collected in 23 all-night sleep measurements and containing BMAs from involuntary movements during sleep. For reference, three NIRS researchers independently identified BMAs from the data. To determine whether the use of an accelerometer improves BMA detection accuracy, we compared ABAMAR to motion detection based on peaks in the moving standard deviation (SD) of NIRS data. The number of BMAs identified by ABAMAR was similar to the number detected by the humans, and 79 of the artifacts identified by ABAMAR were confirmed by at least two humans. While the moving SD of NIRS data could also be used for motion detection, on average 2 out of the 10 largest SD peaks in NIRS data each night occurred without the presence of movement. Thus, using an accelerometer improves BMA detection accuracy in NIRS. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging of changes in cerebral blood oxygenation (CBO) delineated areas of neural activation during self-paced unilateral middle finger tapping in five normal volunteers. Four contiguous imaging sections parallel to the bicommissural plane covered the hand area of the primary sensori-motor cortex bilaterally. All measurements were performed at 2.0 T using rapid gradient-echo sequences (TR/TE = 63/60 ms) with high spatial resolution (0.8×1.6× 4 mm) and both strong (40° flip angle) and weak (10°) radiofrequency excitation pulses. This allows differentiation of flow and CBO contributions to the observed signal alterations. Functional cooperativity was analysed by a pixel-by-pixel correlation of signal intensity time courses with the stimulus protocol. Areas of activation included the contralateral primary motor cortex, the homologue part of the primary sensory cortex, the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the lateral premotor areas in all volunteers. Task-related activation of ipsilateral primary motor cortex above a threshold correlation coefficient of 0.5 was seen in two out of five volunteers (at 40°) and one out of five (at 10°) when performing the right-hand task. The present MRI findings readily demonstrate in single subjects that the SMA is involved in self-paced finger tapping. Only sparse activation in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex is consistent with the motor paradigm used. {\textcopyright} 1994 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) allows the recovery of the hemodynamic response associated with evoked brain activity. The signal is contaminated with systemic physiological interference which occurs in the superficial layers of the head as well as in the brain tissue. The back-reflection geometry of the measurement makes the DOI signal strongly contaminated by systemic interference occurring in the superficial layers. A recent development has been the use of signals from small source-detector separation (1cm) optodes as regressors. Since those additional measurements are mainly sensitive to superficial layers in adult humans, they help in removing the systemic interference present in longer separation measurements (3cm). Encouraged by those findings, we developed a dynamic estimation procedure to remove global interference using small optode separations and to estimate simultaneously the hemodynamic response. The algorithm was tested by recovering a simulated synthetic hemodynamic response added over baseline DOI data acquired from 6 human subjects at rest. The performance of the algorithm was quantified by the Pearson R2 coefficient and the mean square error (MSE) between the recovered and the simulated hemodynamic responses. Our dynamic estimator was also compared with a static estimator and the traditional adaptive filtering method. We observed a significant improvement (two-tailed paired t-test, p{\textless}0.05) in both HbO and HbR recovery using our Kalman filter dynamic estimator compared to the traditional adaptive filter, the static estimator and the standard GLM technique. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In comparison with controls, MCI subjects showed distinctly increased cortex activity including: the dorsal anterior cingulate, bilateral middle and inferior frontal gyri, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, and the bilateral insular. In contrast, AD subjects exhibited decreased fMRI responses in the regions of the prefrontal cortex listed above. These results imply two different neurophysiological characteristics of MCI and AD. In MCI, a compensatory activity of the prefrontal cortex is observed, whereas in AD a dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex is indicated.},

abstract = {Objectives This study sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine precise estimates of the predictive value of carotid intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for cerebrovascular events. Background There is emerging evidence that MR-based carotid atherosclerotic plaque assessment identifies high-risk features associated with cerebrovascular events. However, available data are based on smaller samples with heterogeneous source populations despite a promising value for noninvasive risk stratification. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library through September 2012 for studies that followed {\textgreater}35 individuals after baseline MRI. Independent observers abstracted information on populations, MR techniques, outcomes, and study quality. Risk estimates of the presence of IPH for cerebrovascular events were derived in random effects regression analysis, and causes of heterogeneity were determined in meta-regression analysis. Results We identified 8 eligible studies including 689 participants who underwent carotid MRI. The prevalence of IPH at baseline was high (49.0{\%}). Over a median follow-up of 19.6 months, a total of 108 cerebrovascular events occurred (15.7{\%} event rate). The presence of IPH was associated with an ∼6-fold higher risk for events (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.69; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 2.98 to 10.87). The annualized event rate in subjects with detectable IPH was 17.71{\%} compared with 2.43{\%} in patients without IPH. Meta-regression analysis showed symptomatic subjects had higher risks as compared with asymptomatic subjects (HR: 11.71, 95{\%} CI: 5.17 to 26.48 vs. HR: 3.50, 95{\%} CI: 2.59 to 4.73, p = 0.0065), Also, differences were observed for sex and sample size (all p {\textless} 0.01), with moderate visual publication bias due to missing smaller sample-size studies (p = 0.18). Conclusions Presence of IPH on MRI strongly predicts cerebrovascular events. Homogenization of future studies is warranted to allow for sufficient assessment of level of evidence for intervention trials. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation Published by Elsevier Inc.},

This article examines the issue of "silent" strokes in the relationship between the structural stability of atherosclerotic carotid plaque and the development of nonmotor symptomatology, including cognitive decline. It addresses the question of the role of carotid emboli in silent stroke and their cognitive sequelae. In a study of endarterectomy patients, we relate plaque elasticity and its development of mechanical strain features and thinning of stabilizing fibrous cap at the point of these mechanical strain features. The possibility that microemboli from such mechanically unstable carotid plaques could contribute to silent strokes led to a study of cognitive function in such patients. A linear relationship between the process of mechanically unstable areas of carotid plaques and cognitive decline suggests a contributory role for such a process in silent strokes.},

abstract = {Background: Atherosclerosis may be linked to cognitive decline and depression in old age. Methods: The Leiden 85-Plus Study is a prospective population-based study of 599 subjects from age 85 onward. The generalized atherosclerotic burden was rated by the number of cardiovascular pathologies at baseline, as assessed by history taking from treating physicians and EKG. Cardiovascular pathologies included myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or myocardial ischemia, claudicatio intermittens, and arterial surgery. Global cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination), attention (Stroop Test), processing speed (Letter Digit Coding Test), immediate recall memory (Word Learning Test-Immediate Recall), delayed recall memory (Word Learning Test-Delayed Recall), and depressive symptoms (15-item Geriatric Depression Scale) were assessed each year from ages 85 through 90. The prospective associations between both the generalized atherosclerosis rating and stroke with cognitive function and depressive symptoms were analyzed by linear mixed models adjusted for sex and level of education. Results: During follow-up, there was a significant cognitive decline and a significant increase of depressive symptoms. At baseline, a history of stroke was correlated with lower global cognitive function, slower processing speed, impaired immediate and delayed recall memory, and more depressive symptoms. In addition, a higher generalized atherosclerosis rating was correlated with impaired global cognitive function, lower attention, and a slower processing speed at baseline. During follow-up, a higher generalized atherosclerosis rating was associated with an accelerated decline of immediate recall memory and delayed recall memory. In contrast, there was no relation between the generalized atherosclerosis rating and depressive symptoms, either in the cross-sectional analysis or in the prospective analysis. Conclusion: In the population at large, generalized atherosclerosis contributes to cognitive decline in old age but not to depression. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.},

abstract = {We describe a system of parcellation of the human brain that is based on the functional anatomy of the cerebral cortex and that is applied to the analysis of magnetic resonance images. This system is designed to support investigations of hemispheric asymmetries and quantitative lesion localization studies in cognitive neuroscience. The system of cortical subdivision is a neural systems oriented model that approximates subdivisions supported by previous architectonic and functional analyses. It is based primarily on boundaries determined by 'limiting fissures.' It is completed by a set of coronal planes, keyed to visible anatomic landmarks, which 'close' the borders of the parcellation subdivisions. The method depends on computational reconstruction of the primary image data in multiple planes so as to allow the observed pattern of limiting fissures in a given brain to be digitized. In this presentation, the method is applied in order to define the surface anatomy of the cerebral hemispheres in a normal subject. Volumetric measurements of individual cortical regions are compared as hemispheric percentiles to areal percentiles derived from the analysis of Jouandet et al. (1989), a conceptually related though methodologically different approach. We specifically address the approach to the study of interhemispheric differences and interindividual variations in cortical anatomy.},

abstract = {A method for detecting significant and regionally specific correlations between sensory input and the brain's physiological response, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is presented in this paper. The method involves testing for correlations between sensory input and the hemodynamic response after convolving the sensory input with an estimate of the hemodynamic response function. This estimate is obtained without reference to any assumed input. To lend the approach statistical validity, it is brought into the framework of statistical parametric mapping by using a measure of cross‐correlations between sensory input and hemodynamic response that is valid in the presence of intrinsic autocorrelations. These autocorrelations are necessarily present, due to the hemodynamic response function or temporal point spread function. {\textcopyright} 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

abstract = {Motion artifacts are a significant source of noise in many functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiments. Despite this, there is no well-established method for their removal. Instead, functional trials of fNIRS data containing a motion artifact are often rejected completely. However, in most experimental circumstances the number of trials is limited, and multiple motion artifacts are common, particularly in challenging populations. Many methods have been proposed recently to correct for motion artifacts, including principle component analysis, spline interpolation, Kalman filtering, wavelet filtering and correlation-based signal improvement. The performance of different techniques has been often compared in simulations, but only rarely has it been assessed on real functional data. Here, we compare the performance of these motion correction techniques on real functional data acquired during a cognitive task, which required the participant to speak aloud, leading to a low-frequency, low-amplitude motion artifact that is correlated with the hemodynamic response. To compare the efficacy of these methods, objective metrics related to the physiology of the hemodynamic response have been derived. Our results show that it is always better to correct for motion artifacts than reject trials, and that wavelet filtering is the most effective approach to correcting this type of artifact, reducing the area under the curve where the artifact is present in 93{\%} of the cases. Our results therefore support previous studies that have shown wavelet filtering to be the most promising and powerful technique for the correction of motion artifacts in fNIRS data. The analyses performed here can serve as a guide for others to objectively test the impact of different motion correction algorithms and therefore select the most appropriate for the analysis of their own fNIRS experiment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

This reduces the risk of selective attrition biasing associations between lifetime risk factors and health outcomes in later life and ensures the studies remain as representative as possible of the original population. We report the participation patterns for a postal questionnaire and home visit at 68–69 years of study members in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, the oldest and longest-running British birth cohort study. We investigated how participation varied by lifetime and recent contact, health status, previous clinical feedback and study engagement, taking account of prior socioeconomic and cognitive characteristics. Overall participation and home visit participation remained high (94 and 80{\%}, respectively) and there were no gender differences. Participation was higher in those with higher levels of prior contact and lower in those with the poorest health status. Having previously received clinical feedback on actionable blood results was associated with reduced home visit participation but other forms of clinical feedback were not associated with subsequent participation. Activities that fostered study engagement were associated with increased home visit participation. These findings inform strategies to maintain participation in life course studies.},

abstract = {Background: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a method for monitoring hemoglobin responses using optical probes placed on the scalp. fNIRS spatial resolution is limited by the distance between channels defined as a pair of source and detector, and channel positions are often inconsistent across subjects. These challenges can lead to less accurate estimate of group level effects from channel-specific measurements. New method: This paper addresses this shortcoming by applying random-effects analysis using summary statistics to interpolated fNIRS topographic images. Specifically, we generate individual contrast images containing the experimental effects of interest in a canonical scalp surface. Random-effects analysis then allows for making inference about the regionally specific effects induced by (potentially) multiple experimental factors in a population. Results: We illustrate the approach using experimental data acquired during a colour-word matching Stroop task, and show that left frontopolar regions are significantly activated in a population during Stroop effects. This result agrees with previous neuroimaging findings. Compared with existing methods: The proposed methods (i) address potential misalignment of sensor locations between subjects using spatial interpolation; (ii) produce experimental effects of interest either on a 2D regular grid or on a 3D triangular mesh, both representations of a canonical scalp surface; and (iii) enables one to infer population effects from fNIRS data using a computationally efficient summary statistic approach (random-effects analysis). Significance of regional effects is assessed using random field theory. Conclusions: In this paper, we have shown how fNIRS data from multiple subjects can be analysed in sensor space using random-effects analysis.},

abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a promising technology for functional brain imaging which measures hemodynamic signals from the cortex, similar to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but does not require the participant to lie motionless in a confined space. NIRS can therefore be used for more naturalistic experiments, including face to face communication, or natural body movements, and is well suited for real-time applications that may require lengthy training. However, improving signal quality and reducing noise, especially noise induced by head motion, is challenging, particularly for real time applications. Here we study the properties of head motion induced noise, and find that motion noise causes the measured oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin signals, which are typically strongly negatively correlated, to become more positively correlated. Next, we develop a method to reduce noise based on the principle that the concentration changes of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin should be negatively correlated. We show that despite its simplicity, this method is effective in reducing noise and improving signal quality, for both online and offline noise reduction. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Objective.—To examine the prevalence, incidence, predisposing factors for hypertension, its hazards as an ingredient of the cardiovascular risk profile, and the implications of this information for prevention and treatment.Methods.—Prospective longitudinal analysis of 36-year follow-up data from the Framingham Study of the relation of antecedent blood pressure to occurrence of subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality depending on the metabolically linked burden of associated risk factors.Results.—Hypertension is one of the most prevalent and powerful contributors to cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of death in the United States. There is, on average, a 20 mm Hg systolic and 10 mm Hg diastolic increment increase in blood pressure from age 30 to 65 years. Isolated systolic hypertension is the dominant variety. There is no evidence of a decline in the prevalence of hypertension over 4 decades despite improvements in its detection and treatment. Hypertension contributes to all of the major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes increasing risk, on average, 2- to 3-fold. Coronary disease, the most lethal and common sequela, deserves highest priority. Hypertension clusters with dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and obesity, occurring in isolation in less than 20{\%}. The hazard depends on the number of these associated metabolically linked risk factors present. Coexistent overt cardiovascular disease also influences the hazard and choice of therapy.Conclusion.—The absence of a decline in the prevalence of hypertension indicates an urgent need for primary prevention by weight control, exercise, and reduced salt and alcohol intake. The urgency and choice of therapy of existing hypertension should be based on the multivariate cardiovascular risk profile that more appropriately targets hypertensive persons for treatment and prevention of cardiovascular sequelae.(JAMA. 1996;275:1571-1576)},

abstract = {Purpose Adolescents with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) often experience ill-defined cognitive impairment referred to by patients as "brain fog." The objective of this study was to evaluate the symptom of brain fog as a means of gaining further insight into its etiology and potential palliative interventions. Methods Eligible subjects who reported having been diagnosed with POTS were recruited from social media web sites. Subjects were asked to complete a 38-item questionnaire designed for this study, and the Wood mental fatigue inventory (WMFI). Results Responses were received from 138 subjects with POTS (88 {\%} female), ranging in age from 14 to 29 years; 132 subjects reported brain fog. WMFI scores correlated with brain fog frequency and severity (P {\textless} 0.001). The top ranked descriptors of brain fog were "forgetful," "cloudy," and "difficulty focusing, thinking and communicating." The most frequently reported brain fog triggers were fatigue (91 {\%}), lack of sleep (90 {\%}), prolonged standing (87 {\%}), dehydration (86 {\%}), and feeling faint (85 {\%}). Although aggravated by upright posture, brain fog was reported to persist after assuming a recumbent posture. The most frequently reported interventions for the treatment of brain fog were intravenous saline (77 {\%}), stimulant medications (67 {\%}), salt tablets (54 {\%}), intra-muscular vitamin B-12 injections (48 {\%}), and midodrine (45 {\%}). Conclusions: Descriptors for "brain fog" are most consistent with it being a cognitive complaint. Factors other than upright posture may play a role in the persistence of this symptom. Subjects reported a number of therapeutic interventions for brain fog not typically used in the treatment of POTS that may warrant further investigation. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop a new method for the measurement in humans of the compliance of the microvascular superficial venous system of the lower limb by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). This method is complementary to strain-gauge plethysmography, which does not allow compliance between deep and superficial venous or between venous and arterial compartments to be distinguished. In practice, hydrostatic pressure (P) changes were induced in a calf region of interest by head-up tilt of the subject from $\alpha$ = -10 to 75°. For P ≤ 24 mmHg, the measured compliance [0.086 ± 0.005 (SD) ml{\textperiodcentered}l-1{\textperiodcentered}mmHg-1] based on NIRS data of total, deoxygenated, and oxygenated hemoglobin, reflects essentially that of the superficial venous system. For P ≥ 24 mmHg, no distinction can be made between arterial and venous volumes changes. However, by following the changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin in the P range -16 to 100 mmHg, it appears to be possible to assess the characteristics of the vasomotor response of the arteriolar system.},

abstract = {Dementia is not part of ageing. In 2015, 47.5 million people are estimated to be living with dementia (1). There are 7.7 million new cases of dementia each year, implying that there is a new case of dementia somewhere in the world every four seconds. The accelerating rates of dementia are cause for immediate action, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LAMIC) where resources are few. The huge cost of the disease will challenge health systems to deal with the predicted future increase of prevalence as long as there is no cure. The costs are estimated at US{\$} 604 billion per year at present and are set to increase even more quickly than the prevalence. People live for many years after the onset of symptoms of dementia. With appropriate support, many can and should be enabled to continue to engage and contribute within society and have a good quality of life. Dementia is overwhelming for the family and other caregivers and adequate support is required for them, from the health, social, financial and legal systems. Countries must include dementia on their public health agendas. Sustained action and coordination is required across multiple levels and with all stakeholders at international, national, regional and local levels. KEY MESSAGES . People living with dementia and their caregivers often have unique insights to their condition and life. They should be involved in formulating the policies, plans, laws and services that relate to them. The time to act is now by: promoting a dementia friendly society globally; making dementia a national public health and social care priority worldwide; improving public and professional attitudes to, and understanding of, dementia; investing in health and social systems to improve care and services for people living with dementia and their caregivers; increasing the priority given to dementia in the public health research agenda.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a reliable project scheduling approach, which integrates the risk management and critical chain schedule analyses. Since various risks and uncertainties exist in a project which may not only prevent the project to be completed within budget and time limit, but also threaten the quality, safety and operational needs. In the proposed method the potential project risks are taken into account and risk response strategies are developed by fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) and then varying effects of each risk over each activity. The project total time can then be quantified and simulated by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) as an effective technique in uncertain conditions due to its capability of converting uncertainty to risk judgmentally in projects. Following this procedure fault tree analysis and event tree analysis will be used to get risk mitigations. Eventually, for a reliable schedule we distribute a critical chain schedule which allows one to implement the project as planned and obtain reasonable feeding buffer time and project buffer time. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

abstract = {Handedness is associated with cerebral organisation, but its relationship with cognition remains unclear. Since the Stroop task is believed to measure aspects of executive control, this study aims to investigate the effect of handedness on Stroop interference. We used the Stroop task with 90 young adults with university education, of whom 47 (23 males) were right-handed and 43 (21 males) were left-handed. Main dependent variables were Stroop baseline (SB), Stroop incongruent (SI), and the proportional derivative Stroop reduction (SR) [SR=(SB - SI)/SB × 100{\%}] (Bugg, Delosh, Davalos, {\&} Davis, 2007; Graf, Uttl, {\&}Tuokko, 1995) scores. The analysis revealed that SI is significantly affected by both handedness and the interaction of sex × handedness, whereas SR is only affected by handedness. After controlling for the effect of SB on SI, only the effect of handedness remained statistically significant [F(1, 83) = 6.44, p=.013]. Post-hoc comparisons showed that left-handed females performed significantly better than right-handed females on both SI (p=.003) and SR (p=.007). The data suggest that handedness is associated with cognitive function alterations, which lead to a smaller Stroop interference of left-handers irrespectively of sex, an effect that is more pronounced in the female subpopulation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Psychology Press.},

abstract = {Objectives: Prevention of cognitive decline and dementia with blood pressure lowering treatments has shown inconsistent results. We compared the effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on the incidence of dementia, and on cognitive function. METHODS:: We conducted a systematic review and included 19 randomized trials (18 515 individuals) and 11 studies (831 674 individuals) analysing the effects of antihypertensive treatment on cognition and on the incidence of dementia, respectively, in hypertensive patients without prior cerebrovascular disorders. Network meta-analysis was used for the comparison of antihypertensive classes. Results: Antihypertensive treatment, regardless of the drug class, had benefits on overall cognition [effect size 0.05, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.07] and all cognitive functions except language. Antihypertensive treatment reduced the risk of all-cause dementia by 9{\%}, with reference to the control group (hazard ratio 0.91, 95{\%} CI 0.89-0.94), when randomized trials and observationnal studies were combined (n = 15). Result was not significant with randomized trials alone (n = 4). Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) had larger benefits than placebo on overall cognition (adjusted effect size 0.60 ± 0.18, P = 0.02). ARBs were more effective than $\beta$-blockers (0.67 ± 0.18, P = 0.01), diuretics (0.54 ± 0.19, P = 0.04) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (0.47 ± 0.17, P = 0.04) in rank. The mean change in blood pressure did not differ significantly between the different antihypertensive drug classes. Conclusion: Our results support the notion that antihypertensive treatment has beneficial effects on cognitive decline and prevention of dementia, and indicate that these effects may differ between drug classes with ARBs possibly being the most effective. {\textcopyright} 2013 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = { Cerebral blood flow responses to transient blood pressure challenges are frequently attributed to cerebral autoregulation (CA), yet accumulating evidence indicates vascular properties like compliance are also influential. We hypothesized that middle cerebral blood velocity (MCAv) dynamics during or following a transient blood pressure perturbation can be accurately explained by the windkessel mechanism. Eighteen volunteers underwent blood pressure manipulations, including bilateral thigh-cuff deflation and sit-to-stand maneuvers under normocapnic and hypercapnic (5{\%} CO 2 ) conditions. Pressure-flow recordings were analyzed using a windkessel analysis approach that partitions the frequency-dependent resistance and compliance contributions to MCAv dynamics. The windkessel was typically able to explain more than 50{\%} of the MCAv variance, as indicated by R 2 values for both the flow recovery and postrecovery phase. The most consistent predictors of MCAv dynamics under the control condition were the windkessel capacitive gain and high-frequency resistive gain. However, there were significant interindividual variations in the composition of windkessel predictors. Hypercapnia consistently reduced the capacitive gain and enhanced the low-frequency (0.04–0.20 Hz) resistive gain for both thigh-cuff deflation and sit-to-stand trials. These findings indicate that 1) MCAv dynamics during acute transient hypotension challenges are dominated by cerebrovascular windkessel properties independent of CA; 2) there is significant heterogeneity in windkessel properties between individuals; and 3) hemodynamic effects of hypercapnia during transient blood pressure challenges primarily reflect changes in windkessel properties rather than pure CA impairment. },

abstract = {Background: There is growing interest in the relationship between time spent in adverse circumstances across life course and increased risk of chronic disease and early mortality. This accumulation hypothesis is usually tested by summing indicators of binary variables across the life span to form an overall score that is then used as the exposure in regression models for health outcomes. This article highlights potential issues in the interpretation of results obtained from such an approach. Methods: We propose a model-building framework that can be used to formally compare alternative hypotheses on the effect of multiple binary exposure measurements collected across the life course. The saturated model where the order and value of the binary variable at each time point influence the outcome of interest is compared with nested alternative specifications corresponding to the critical period, cumulative risk or hypotheses about the effect of changes in environment. This framework is illustrated with data on adult body mass index and socioeconomic position measured once in childhood and twice in adulthood from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, using a series of liner regression models. Results: We demonstrate how analyses that only consider the association of a cumulative score with a later outcome may produce misleading results. Conclusion: We recommend comparing a set of nested models - each corresponding to the accumulation, critical period and effect modification hypotheses - to an all-inclusive (saturated) model. This approach can provide a formal and clearer understanding of the relative merits of these alternative hypotheses. {\textcopyright} Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association {\textcopyright} The Author 2008; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {A major methodological challenge of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is its high sensitivity to haemodynamic fluctuations in the scalp. Superficial fluctuations contribute on the one hand to the physiological noise of fNIRS, impairing the signal-to-noise ratio, and may on the other hand be erroneously attributed to cerebral changes, leading to false positives in fNIRS experiments. Here we explore the localisation, time course and physiological origin of task-evoked superficial signals in fNIRS and present a method to separate them from cortical signals. We used complementary fNIRS, fMRI, MR-angiography and peripheral physiological measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, skin conductance and skin blood flow) to study activation in the frontal lobe during a continuous performance task. The General Linear Model (GLM) was applied to analyse the fNIRS data, which included an additional predictor to account for systemic changes in the skin.We found that skin blood volume strongly depends on the cognitive state and that sources of task-evoked systemic signals in fNIRS are co-localized with veins draining the scalp. Task-evoked superficial artefacts were mainly observed in concentration changes of oxygenated haemoglobin and could be effectively separated from cerebral signals by GLM analysis. Based on temporal correlation of fNIRS and fMRI signals with peripheral physiological measurements we conclude that the physiological origin of the systemic artefact is a task-evoked sympathetic arterial vasoconstriction followed by a decrease in venous volume.Since changes in sympathetic outflow accompany almost any cognitive and emotional process, we expect scalp vessel artefacts to be present in a wide range of fNIRS settings used in neurocognitive research. Therefore a careful separation of fNIRS signals originating from activated brain and from scalp is a necessary precondition for unbiased fNIRS brain activation maps. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {To evaluate neural changes during a Stroop task among individuals with TBI using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Thirteen healthy controls and 14 patients with moderate to severe TBI were included in this study. Oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) was recorded every tenth of a second using a 52-channel fNIRS unit. Data were acquired using a block design during a Stroop task (i.e., Condition A = Dot Color Naming, Condition B = Incongruent Condition). Visual stimuli were presented on a computer monitor. Behaviorally, response accuracy was similar between groups for condition A, but the TBI group made more errors than the control group during condition B. During condition A, the patient group demonstrated significant increases in HbO within bilateral frontal regions compared to controls (p {\textless} 0.01). When examining the Stroop interference effect (B-A), controls showed increased HbO in bilateral frontal lobes and left inferior parietal region suggesting increased neural response to increased cognitive demand, whereas no differences were detected among the TBI group (p {\textless} 0.05). No between group differences in latency of HbO response was observed during either condition. While the TBI group performed as accurately as controls on the simpler dot color naming condition of the Stroop task, neural activity was greater within the frontal lobes during this relatively simple task among the TBI group suggesting neural inefficiency. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of neural activity related to the interference effect was not different among patients, suggesting the neural demand for the simpler task was comparable to that of the more cognitive demanding task among the TBI sample. The results suggest that fNIRS can identify frontal lobe inefficiency in TBI commonly observed with fMRI.},

Questions remain, however, about its lateralization correlates during Stroop task performance, an experimental cornerstone on which a large amount of cognitive control research is based. After reviewing the literature, we find that three Stroop variants have been used in an attempt to uncover different aspects of cognitive control related to DLPFC involvement. In sum, rapid and sequential up-regulation of the attentional set seems to be related to the left DLPFC. These attentional adjustments are based on participants' expectancies regarding the conflicting nature of the upcoming trial, and not on the conflict itself. In contrast, the right DLPFC is associated with an overall up-regulation of the attentional set when attentional conflict is experienced. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract = {Vascular dysfunction has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data from brain imaging studies in humans and animal models suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegenerative changes in AD and AD models. Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid $\beta$-peptide (A$\beta$) clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia AD type. Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively affects the synthesis of proteins required for memory and learning, and may eventually lead to neuritic injury and neuronal death. Impaired clearance of A$\beta$ from the brain by the cells of the neurovascular unit may lead to its accumulation on blood vessels and in brain parenchyma. The accumulation of A$\beta$ on the cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with cognitive decline and is one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. CAA can severely disrupt the integrity of the blood vessel wall resulting in micro or macro intracerebral bleedings that exacerbates neurodegenerative process and inflammatory response and may lead to hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Here, we review the role of the neurovascular unit and molecular mechanisms in vascular cells behind AD and CAA pathogenesis. First, we discuss apparent vascular changes, including the cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular degeneration that contribute to different stages of the disease process in AD individuals. We next discuss the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP), a key A$\beta$ clearance receptor at the BBB and along the cerebrovascular system, whose expression is suppressed early in AD. We also discuss how brain-derived apolipoprotein E isoforms may influence A$\beta$ clearance across the BBB. We then review the role of two interacting transcription factors, myocardin and serum response factor, in cerebral vascular cells in controlling CBF responses and LRP-mediated A$\beta$ clearance. Finally, we discuss the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages in A$\beta$ clearance from the brain. The data reviewed here support an essential role of neurovascular and BBB mechanisms in contributing to both, onset and progression of AD. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

Thirty-two participants tasted seven spoons of identical dimensions plated with each of the following metals: gold, silver, zinc, copper, tin, chrome and stainless steel. More negative standard electrode potentials were found to be good predictors of solid metals that had tastes scoring highest for the taste descriptors strong, bitter and metallic. Thus, it was found that both gold and chrome (having the most positive standard electrode potentials) were considered the least metallic, least bitter and least strong tasting of the spoons. Zinc and copper (having the most negative standard electrode potentials) were the strongest, most metallic, most bitter, and least sweet tasting of the spoons.

Here we used fMRI measures of neural activity during performance of the color-word Stroop task to compare the neural substrates of attentional control in younger (ages: 21-27 years old) and older participants (ages: 60-75 years old) during conditions of both increased competition (incongruent and congruent neutral) and increased conflict (incongruent and congruent neutral). We found evidence of age-related decreases in the responsiveness of structures thought to support attentional control (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices), suggesting possible impairments in the implementation of attentional control in older participants. Consistent with this notion, older participants exhibited more extensive activation of ventral visual processing regions (i.e., temporal cortex) and anterior inferior prefrontal cortices, reflecting a decreased ability to inhibit the processing of task-irrelevant information. Also, the anterior cingulate cortex, a region involved in evaluatory processes at the level of response (e.g., detecting potential for error), showed age-related increases in its sensitivity to the presence of competing color information. These findings are discussed in terms of newly emerging models of attentional control in the human brain. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

This may hamper the validity of fNIRS signal interpretations and associations between individual traits and brain activation, such as the link between impulsivity-related personality traits and decreased prefrontal cognitive control during reward-based decision making.Hemodynamic responses elicited by an intertemporal choice reward task in 20 healthy subjects were investigated for multimodal correlations of simultaneous fNIRS-fMRI and for an impact of anatomy and scalp fMRI signal fluctuations on fNIRS signals. Moreover, correlations of prefrontal activation with trait "sensitivity to reward" (SR) were investigated for differences between methods.While showing substantial individual variability, temporal fNIRS-fMRI correlations increased with the activation, which both methods consistently detected within right inferior/middle frontal gyrus. Here, up to 41{\%} of fNIRS channel activation variance was explained by individual gray matter volume simulated to be reached by near-infrared light, and up to 20{\%} by scalp-cortex distance. Extracranial fMRI and fNIRS time series showed significant temporal correlations in the temple region. SR was negatively correlated with fMRI but not fNIRS activation elicited by immediate rewards of choice within right inferior/middle frontal gyrus. Higher SR increased the correlation between extracranial fMRI and fNIRS signals and decreased fNIRS-fMRI correlations.Task-related fNIRS signals might be impacted by regionally and individually weighted sources of anatomical and systemic physiological error variance. Trait-activation correlations might be affected or biased by systemic physiological responses, which should be accounted for in future fNIRS studies of interindividual differences. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that a specific region in the posterior frontolateral cortex is involved intimately in cognitive control processes. This region, located in the vicinity of the junction of the inferior frontal sulcus and the inferior precentral sulcus, was termed the inferior frontal junction (IFJ). The IFJ was shown to be involved in the updating of task representations and to be activated commonly in a within-subject investigation of a task-switching paradigm, the Stroop task, and a verbal n-back task. Here, we investigate the involvement of the IFJ in cognitive control by employing a meta-analytic approach. Two quantitative meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies were conducted. One meta-analysis included frontal activations from task-switching, set-shifting, and stimulus-response (S-R) reversal studies, the other included frontal activations from color-word Stroop studies. Results showed highly significant clustering of activations in the IFJ in both analyses. These results provide strong evidence for the consistent involvement of the IFJ in both switching and Stroop paradigms. Furthermore, they support our concept of areal specialization in the frontolateral cortex, which posits that it is not only the middorsolateral part that plays an important role in cognitive control, but also the IFJ. Finally, our results demonstrate how quantitative meta-analyses can be used to test hypotheses about the involvement of specific brain regions in cognitive control. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Cerebrovascular disease and vascular risk factors are associated with Alzheimer's disease, but the evidence for their association with other neurodegenerative disorders is limited. Therefore, we compared the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease, vascular pathology and vascular risk factors in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases and correlate them with dementia severity. Presence of cerebrovascular disease, vascular pathology and vascular risk factors was studied in 5715 cases of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre database with a single neurodegenerative disease diagnosis (Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to tau, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 immunoreactive deposits, $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, hippocampal sclerosis and prion disease) based on a neuropathological examination with or without cerebrovascular disease, defined neuropathologically. In addition, 210 'unremarkable brain' cases without cognitive impairment, and 280 cases with pure cerebrovascular disease were included for comparison. Cases with cerebrovascular disease were older than those without cerebrovascular disease in all the groups except for those with hippocampal sclerosis. After controlling for age and gender as fixed effects and centre as a random effect, we observed that $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43, and prion disease showed a lower prevalence of coincident cerebrovascular disease than patients with Alzheimer's disease, and this was more significant in younger subjects. When cerebrovascular disease was also present, patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with $\alpha$-synucleinopathy showed relatively lower burdens of their respective lesions than those without cerebrovascular disease in the context of comparable severity of dementia at time of death. Concurrent cerebrovascular disease is a common neuropathological finding in aged subjects with dementia, is more common in Alzheimer's disease than in other neurodegenerative disorders, especially in younger subjects, and lowers the threshold for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, which suggests that these disorders should be targeted by treatments for cerebrovascular disease. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author (2013).

abstract = {Objective: Identifying and recruiting people with early pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's disease to neuroimaging research studies is increasingly important. The extent to which results of these studies can be generalised depends on the recruitment and representativeness of the participants involved. We now report the recruitment and participation patterns from a neuroscience sub-study of the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, "Insight 46". This study aimed to recruit 500 participants for extensive clinical and neuropsychological testing, and neuroimaging. We investigate how sociodemographic factors, health conditions and health-related behaviours predict participation at different levels of recruitment. Results: We met our target recruitment (n = 502). Higher educational attainment and non-manual socio-economic position (SEP) were consistent predictors of recruitment. Health-related variables were also predictive at every level of recruitment; in particular higher cognition, not smoking and better self-rating health. Sex and APOE-e4 status were not predictors of participation at any level. Whilst recruitment targets were met, individuals with lower SEP, lower cognition, and more health problems are under-represented in Insight 46. Understanding the factors that influence recruitment are important when interpreting results; for Insight 46 it is likely that health-related outcomes and life course risks will under-estimate those seen in the general population.},

abstract = {Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent and disabling feature of autonomic failure due to both peripheral and central neurodegenerative diseases. Community-based epidemiological studies have demonstrated a high morbidity and mortality associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. It is due to impairment of baroreflex-mediated vasoconstriction of the skeletal muscle and splanchnic circulation and is caused by damage or dysfunction at central and/or peripheral sites in the baroreflex efferent pathway. Nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions may be implemented to ameliorate the symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and improve quality of life. Many patients will be adequately treated by education, counseling, removal of hypotensive medications, and other nonpharmacological interventions, whereas more severely afflicted patients require pharmacological interventions. The first stage of pharmacological treatment involves repletion of central blood volume. If unsuccessful, this should be followed by treatment with sympathomimetic agents.},

abstract = {Functional hemodynamic responses are the composite results of underlying variations in cerebral oxygen consumption and the dilation of arterial vessels after neuronal activity. The development of biophysically based models of the cerebral vasculature allows the separation of the neuro-metabolic and neuro-vascular influences on measurable hemodynamic signals such as functional magnetic resonance imaging or optical imaging. We describe a multicompartment model of the vascular and oxygen transport dynamics associated with stimulus-driven neuronal activation. Our model offers several unique features compared with previous formulations such as the ability to estimate baseline blood flow, volume, and oxygen consumption from functional data. In addition, we introduce a capillary compliance model, arterial and venous oxygen permeability, and model the dynamics of extravascular tissue oxygenation. We apply this model to multimodal optical spectroscopic and laser speckle imaging of the rat somato-sensory cortex during nine conditions of whisker stimulation. By fitting the model using a psuedo-Bayesian framework to incorporate multimodal observations, we estimate baseline blood flow to be 94 (+/-15) mL/100 g min and baseline oxygen consumption to be 6.7 (+/-1.3) mL O(2)/100 g min. We calculate parametric, linear increases in arterial dilation (R(2)=0.96) and CMRO(2) (R(2)=0.87) responses over the nine conditions. Other parameters estimated by the model include vascular transit time and volume reserve, oxygen content, saturation, diffusivity rate constants, and partial pressure of oxygen in the vascular compartments and in the extravascular tissue. Finally, we compare this model to earlier work and find that the multicompartment model more accurately describes the observed oxygenation changes when compared with a single compartment version.},

The relation of carotid atherosclerosis to cognitive impairment and MRI indices of ischemia and aging in midlife is less clear. Methods-: We studied 1975 Framingham Offspring Study participants free of stroke and dementia with available carotid ultrasound, brain MRI, and neuropsychological testing. We related common and internal carotid artery intima-media thickness and internal carotid stenosis to large white matter hyperintensity ({\textgreater}1 SD above age-specific mean), total brain volume, hippocampal volume, silent cerebral infarcts, and neuropsychological measures of verbal memory, executive function, and nonverbal memory measures. Results-: We observed that internal carotid artery intima-media thickness, but not common carotid artery intima-media thickness, was associated with higher prevalence of silent cerebral infarcts (OR, 1.21; 95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.43; P{\textless}0.05), large white matter hyperintensity (OR, 1.19; 95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.38; P{\textless}0.05), lower total brain volume (-0.05 per SD; P{\textless}0.05), and poorer performance in verbal memory (-0.06 per SD; P{\textless}0.05) and nonverbal memory measures (-0.08 per SD; P{\textless}0.01), but not with hippocampal volume. Internal carotid stenosis =25{\%} was associated with a higher prevalence of large white matter hyperintensity (adjusted OR, 1.77; 95{\%} CI, 1.25-2.53) and lower total brain volume (-0.11 per SD; P=0.042) but not with silent cerebral infarcts or hippocampal volume. Internal carotid stenosis =50{\%} was associated with higher prevalence of silent cerebral infarcts (OR, 2.53; 95{\%} CI, 1.17-5.44), large white matter hyperintensity (OR, 2.35; 95{\%} CI, 1.08-5.13), and poorer performance on executive function (-0.39 per SD; P{\textless}0.05), but not with total brain volume or hippocampal volume. Conclusions-: Carotid atherosclerosis markers were associated with MRI indices of brain ischemia and aging and with cognitive impairment in a community-based sample of middle-aged adults. Our data suggest that internal carotid artery intima-media thickness may be a better marker for cognitive impairment than common carotid artery intima-media thickness. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Heart Association, Inc.},

Here, we review the cellular and molecular mechanisms in cerebral blood vessels and the pathophysiological events leading to cerebral blood flow dysregulation and disruption of the neurovascular unit and the blood-brain barrier, which all may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Particularly, we examine the link between neurovascular dysfunction and neurodegeneration including the effects of AD genetic risk factors on cerebrovascular functions and clearance of Alzheimer's amyloid-$\beta$ peptide toxin, and the impact of vascular risk factors, environment, and lifestyle on cerebral blood vessels, which in turn may affect synaptic, neuronal, and cognitive functions. Finally, we examine potential experimental treatments for dementia and AD based on the neurovascular model, and discuss some critical questions to be addressed by future studies.

abstract = {Heart disease is the major leading cause of death and disability in the world. Mainly affecting the elderly population, heart disease and its main outcome, cardiovascular disease, have become an important risk factor in the development of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper examines the evidence linking chronic brain hypoperfusion induced by a variety of cardiovascular deficits in the development of cognitive impairment preceding AD. The evidence indicates a strong association between AD and cardiovascular risk factors, including ApoE4, atrial fibrillation, thrombotic events, hypertension, hypotension, heart failure, high serum markers of inflammation, coronary artery disease, low cardiac index, and valvular pathology. In elderly people whose cerebral perfusion is already diminished by their advanced age, additional reduction of cerebral blood flow stemming from abnormalities in the heart-brain vascular loop ostensibly increases the probability of developing AD. Evidence also suggests that a neuronal energy crisis brought on by relentless brain hypoperfusion may be responsible for protein synthesis abnormalities that later result in the classic neurodegenerative lesions involving the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Insight into how cardiovascular risk factors can induce progressive cognitive impairment offers an enhanced understanding of the multifactorial pathophysiology characterizing AD and ways at preventing or managing the cardiovascular precursors of this dementia. {\textcopyright} 2012 Jack C. de la Torre.},

abstract = {An increasing number of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies utilize a general linear model (GLM) approach, which serves as a standard statistical method for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. While fMRI solely measures the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, fNIRS measures the changes of oxy-hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxy-hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) signals at a temporal resolution severalfold higher. This suggests the necessity of adjusting the temporal parameters of a GLM for fNIRS signals. Thus, we devised a GLM-based method utilizing an adaptive hemodynamic response function (HRF). We sought the optimum temporal parameters to best explain the observed time series data during verbal fluency and naming tasks. The peak delay of the HRF was systematically changed to achieve the best-fit model for the observed oxy- and deoxy-Hb time series data. The optimized peak delay showed different values for each Hb signal and task. When the optimized peak delays were adopted, the deoxy-Hb data yielded comparable activations with similar statistical power and spatial patterns to oxy-Hb data. The adaptive HRF method could suitably explain the behaviors of both Hb parameters during tasks with the different cognitive loads during a time course, and thus would serve as an objective method to fully utilize the temporal structures of all fNIRS data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advanced heart failure is linked with structural and functional alterations in the brain. It is unclear whether a graded decrease in cardiac function puts older subjects at risk for brain aging. We investigated the association between cardiac hemodynamics and features of brain aging in community-dwelling older subjects.
METHODS AND RESULTS: With data from a sub-study (n=931 subjects, mean age 75.9 years, 47.7{\%} male) of the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES)-Reykjavik Study, we investigated the association of MRI measures of cardiac hemodynamics, including left ventricular stroke volume (LVSV) and cardiac output (CO) to brain characteristics. In multivariable analyses, each 10 mL lower LVSV was associated with 4.4 mL (95{\%} CI 1.9 to 6.9) lower total parenchymal brain volume (TBV) and 3.7 mL (95{\%} CI 1.8 to 5.7) lower gray matter volume (GMV). Likewise, each unit (L/min) lower CO was associated with 3.9 mL (95{\%} CI 0.4 to 7.4) lower TBV and 3.9 mL (95{\%} CI 0.4 to 7.4) lower GMV. Lower LVSV was associated with worse performance in processing speed (P=0.043) and executive function (P{\textless}0.001). Lower CO was associated with worse performance in processing speed (P=0.015) and executive function (P=0.003). Each 10 mL lower LVSV and each unit lower CO associated with a higher risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia (odds ratio: 1.24, 95{\%} CI 0.99 to 1.57 and odds ratio: 1.40, 95{\%} CI 0.99 to 2.00, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: A graded decrease in cardiac functioning is associated with features of brain aging. Older persons with cardiac or cognitive signs and symptoms may have both cardiac and cerebral diseases and should be evaluated accordingly.},

abstract = {Even though research in the field of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is being conducted for more than 20 years, a consensus on a signal processing methods is still lacking. A significant knowledge gap exists between established researchers and those newly entering the field. One major issue regularly observed in publications from new researchers in this field is the neglect of a possible signal contamination by hemodynamic changes unrelated to neurovascular coupling (i.e. scalp blood flow and systemic blood flow). This might be due to the fact that these researchers use signal processing methods with tools provided by the manufacturers of their devices without an advanced understanding of the performed steps. The aim of the present study was to investigate how different signal processing approaches (including and excluding approaches that partially correct for the possible signal contamination) affect the results of a typical functional neuroimaging study performed with fNIRS. In particular, we evaluated one standard signal processing method provided by a commercial company and compared it to three customized approaches and investigated the influence of the chosen method on the statistical outcome of a clinical data set (task-evoked motor cortex activity). No short-channels were used in the present study and therefore two types of multi-channel corrections based on multiple long-channels were applied. The choice of the signal processing method had a considerable influence on the outcome of the study. While methods that ignored the contamination of the fNIRS signals by task-evoked physiological noise yielded several significant hemodynamic responses over the whole head, the statistical significance of these findings disappeared when partially accounting for the contamination by using a multi-channel regression. We conclude that, when lacking the possibility of applying multi-distance measurements, the adoption of signal processing methods that correct for the physiological confounding effect, might yield more realistic results. Furthermore, we do not recommend to use standard signal processing methods as provided by the manufacturers without having an advanced understanding of every performed step.},

The present review summarizes recent data from US prospective population studies on blood pressure—systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP)—and cardiovascular risk. The outcome variables include blood pressure-related risks, primarily incidence and mortality from coronary heart disease, stroke, other and all cardiovascular diseases (CVD); also cardiac abnormalites (roentgenographic, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic); also, all-cause mortality and life expectancy. Data accrued during the past 20 years confirm that SBP and DBP have continuous, graded, strong, independent, etiologically significant relationships to the outcome variables. These relationships are documented for young, middle-aged, and older men and for middle-aged and older women of varying socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicity. Among persons aged 35 years or more, most have SBP/DBP above optimal ({\textless}120/{\textless}80 mm Hg); hence, they are at increased CVD risk, ie, the blood pressure problem involves most of the population, not only the substantial minority with clinical HBP. For middleaged and older persons, SBP relates even more strongly to risk than DBP; at every DBP level, higher SBP results in greater CVD risk and curtailment of life expectancy. A great potential exists for improved health and increased longevity through control of the blood pressure problem. Its realization requires a strategy combining populationwide and high-risk approaches, the former to prevent rise of blood pressure with age and to achieve primary prevention of HBP by nutritional-hygienic means; the latter to enhance detection, treatment, and control of HBP. The newly expanded goals of the NHBPEP, aimed at implementing this broader strategy for the solution of the blood pressure problem, merit active support from physicians and all health professionals.(Arch Intern Med. 1993;153:598-615)},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that unilateral finger movements are normally accompanied by a small activation in ipsilateral motor cortex. The magnitude of this activation has been shown to be altered in a number of conditions, particularly in association with stroke recovery. The site of this activation, however, has received limited attention. To address this question, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to study precentral gyms activation in six control and three stroke patients during right index finger tapping, then during left index finger tapping. In each hemisphere, the most significantly activated site (P {\textless} 0.001 required) was identified during ipsilateral and during contralateral finger tapping. In the motor cortex of each hemisphere, the site activated during use of the ipsilateral hand differed from that found during use of the contralateral hand. Among the 11 control hemispheres showing significant activation during both motor tasks, the site for ipsilateral hand representation (relative to contralateral hand site in the same hemisphere) was significantly shifted ventrally in all 11 hemispheres (mean, 11 mm), laterally in 10/11 hemispheres (mean, 12 mm), and anteriorly in 8/11 hemispheres (mean, 10 mm). In 6 of 11 hemispheres, tapping of the contralateral finger simultaneously activated both the ipsilateral and the contralateral finger sites, suggesting bilateral motor control by the ipsilateral finger site.

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a powerful tool for monitoring brain functional activities. Due to its non-invasive and non-restraining nature, fNIRS has found broad applications in brain functional studies. However, for fNIRS to work well, it is important to reduce its sensitivity to motion artifacts. We propose a new wavelet-based method for removing motion artifacts from fNIRS signals. The method relies on differences between artifacts and fNIRS signal in terms of duration and amplitude and is specifically designed for spike artifacts. We assume a gaussian distribution for the wavelet coefficients corresponding to the underlying hemodynamic signal in detail levels and identify the artifact coefficients using this distribution. An input parameter controls the intensity of artifact attenuation in trade-off with the level of distortion introduced in the signal. The method only modifies wavelet coefficients in levels adaptively selected based on the degree of contamination with motion artifact. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, we tested it on experimental fNIRS data collected from three infant subjects. Normalized mean-square error and artifact energy attenuation were used as criteria for performance evaluation. The results show 18.29 and 16.42 dB attenuation in motion artifacts energy for 700 and 830 nm wavelength signals in a total of 29 motion events with no more than -16.7 dB distortion in terms of normalized mean-square error in the artifact-free regions of the signal.},

OT has advantages over conventional fMRI in terms of its simple approach to measuring the hemodynamic response, its ability to distinguish between changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin and the range of human participants that can be readily investigated. We offer a new software tool, functional optical signal analysis (fOSA), for analyzing the spatially resolved optical signals that provides statistical inference capabilities about the distribution of brain activity in space and time and by experimental condition. It does this by mapping the signal into a standard functional neuroimaging analysis software, statistical parametric mapping (SPM), and forms, in effect, a new SPM toolbox specifically designed for NIRS in an OT configuration. The validity of the program has been tested using synthetic data, and its applicability is demonstrated with experimental data.},

Slowing on color naming and word reading was observed, and was greater in moderate than in mild dementia subjects. However, error scores were unrelated to dementia type and severity. The Stroop interference effect, measured with reaction time, was high in individuals with mild ATD and mild non-Alzheimer dementia. In contrast, the more severely impaired ATD subjects showed less Stroop interference effect than mildly impaired subjects when the reaction time was adjusted for color naming performance. These findings are attributed to variation in speed-accuracy tradeoff for the patient groups due to differences in information processing deficits, linguistic impairment, and attitudes to errors. This study demonstrates the importance of partialling out underlying deficits for the understanding of complex cognitive processes in dementia.},

abstract = {The redox state of cerebral mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy ($\delta$[oxCCO]) is a signal with strong potential as a non-invasive, bedside biomarker of cerebral metabolic status. We hypothesised that the higher mitochondrial density of brain compared to skin and skull would lead to evidence of brain-specificity of the $\delta$[oxCCO] signal when measured with a multi-distance near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. Measurements of $\delta$[oxCCO] as well as of concentration changes in oxygenated ($\delta$[HbO2]) and deoxygenated haemoglobin ($\delta$[HHb]) were taken at multiple source-detector distances during systemic hypoxia and hypocapnia (decrease in cerebral oxygen delivery), and hyperoxia and hypercapnia (increase in cerebral oxygen delivery) from 15 adult healthy volunteers. Increasing source-detector spacing is associated with increasing light penetration depth and thus higher sensitivity to cerebral changes. An increase in $\delta$[oxCCO] was observed during the challenges that increased cerebral oxygen delivery and the opposite was observed when cerebral oxygen delivery decreased. A consistent pattern of statistically significant increasing amplitude of the $\delta$[oxCCO] response with increasing light penetration depth was observed in all four challenges, a behaviour that was distinctly different from that of the haemoglobin chromophores, which did not show this statistically significant depth gradient. This depth-dependence of the $\delta$[oxCCO] signal corroborates the notion of higher concentrations of CCO being present in cerebral tissue compared to extracranial components and highlights the value of NIRS-derived $\delta$[oxCCO] as a brain-specific signal of cerebral metabolism, superior in this aspect to haemoglobin. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Autonomic nervous system response is known to be highly task-dependent. The sensitivity of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements to superficial layers, parti cularly to the scalp, makes it highly susceptible to systemic physiological changes. Thus, one critical step in NIRS data processing is to remove the contribution of superficial layers to the NIRS signal and to obtain the actual brain response. This can be achieved using short separation channels that are sensitive only to the hemodynamics in the scalp. We investigated the contribution of hemodynamic fluctuations due to autonomous nervous system activation during various tasks. Our results provide clear demonstrations of the critical role of using short separation channels in NIRS measurements to disentangle differing autonomic responses from the brain activation signal of interest.},

Seven of the patients showed an impairment in executive function (AD+), defined as a performance below the cut off score in at least two of these tests. There were no significant differences in clinical assessments, demographic features, or other cognitive functions between patients.

However, few previous studies have attempted to provide end users of fMRI analysis tools, such as SPM 12, with practical guidelines about how to conduct Bayesian inference. In the present study, we aim to demonstrate how to utilize Bayesian inference, Bayesian second-level inference in particular, implemented in SPM 12 by analyzing fMRI data available to public via NeuroVault. In addition, to help end users understand how Bayesian inference actually works in SPM 12, we examine outcomes from Bayesian second-level inference implemented in SPM 12 by comparing them with those from classical second-level inference. Finally, we provide practical guidelines about how to set the parameters for Bayesian inference and how to interpret the results, such as Bayes factors, from the inference. We also discuss the practical and philosophical benefits of Bayesian inference and directions for future research.},

The elliptical initialisation contours were deformed according to US features such that they conformed to the uterine boundary. The uterus of 15 patients was scanned with 3-D US using the Clarity System (Elekta Ltd.) at multiple days during RT and manually contoured (n = 49 images and corresponding contours). The median (interquartile range) Dice similarity coefficient and mean surface-to-surface-distance between the SE algorithm and manual contours were 0.80 (0.03) and 3.3 (0.2) mm, respectively, which are within the ranges of reported inter-observer contouring variabilities.

abstract = {By 2050, the American 85 years old and over population will triple. Clinicians and the public health community need to develop a culture of sensitivity to the needs of this population and its subgroups. Sensory changes, cognitive changes, and weakness may be subtle or may be severe in the heterogeneous population of people over age 85. Falls, cardiovascular disease, and difficulty with activities of daily living are common but not universal. This paper reviews relevant changes of normal aging, diseases, and syndromes common in people over age 85, cognitive and psychological changes, social and environmental changes, and then reviews common discussions which clinicians routinely have with these patients and their families. Some hearing and vision loss are a part of normal aging as is decline in immune function. Cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis and dementia are common chronic conditions at age 85. Osteoarthritis, diabetes, and related mobility disability will increase in prevalence as the population ages and becomes more overweight. These population changes have considerable public health importance. Caregiver support, services in the home, assistive technologies, and promotion of home exercise programs as well as consideration of transportation and housing policies are recommended. For clinicians, judicious prescribing and ordering of tests includes a consideration of life expectancy, lag time to benefit, and patient goals. Furthermore, healthy behaviors starting in early childhood can optimize quality of life among the oldest-old.},

abstract = {Our primary objective was to investigate a biomarker driven model for the interrelationships between vascular disease pathology, amyloid pathology, and longitudinal cognitive decline in cognitively normal elderly subjects between 70 and 90 years of age. Our secondary objective was to investigate the beneficial effect of cognitive reserve on these interrelationships. We used brain amyloid-b load measured using Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography as a marker for amyloid pathology. White matter hyperintensities and brain infarcts were measured using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging as a marker for vascular pathology. We studied 393 cognitively normal elderly participants in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who had a baseline 3 T fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging assessment, Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography scan, baseline cognitive assessment, lifestyle measures, and at least one additional clinical follow-up. We classified subjects as being on the amyloid pathway if they had a global cortical amyloid-b load of 51.5 standard uptake value ratio and those on the vascular pathway if they had a brain infarct and/or white matter hyperintensities load 51.11{\%} of total intracranial volume (which corresponds to the top 25{\%} of white matter hyperintensities in an independent non-demented sample). We used a global cognitive z-score as a measure of cognition. We found no evidence that the presence or absence of vascular pathology influenced the presence or absence of amyloid pathology and vice versa, suggesting that the two processes seem to be independent. Baseline cognitive performance was lower in older individuals, in males, those with lower education/occupation, and those on the amyloid pathway. The rate of cognitive decline was higher in older individuals (P50.001) and those with amyloid (P = 0.0003) or vascular (P = 0.0037) pathologies. In those subjects with both vascular and amyloid pathologies, the effect of both pathologies on cognition was additive and not synergistic. For a 79-year-old subject, the predicted annual rate of global z-score decline was 0.02 if on neither pathway, 0.07 if on the vascular pathway, 0.08 if on the amyloid pathway and 0.13 if on both pathways. The main conclusions of this study were: (i) amyloid and vascular pathologies seem to be at least partly independent processes that both affect longitudinal cognitive trajectories adversely and are major drivers of cognitive decline in the elderly; and (ii) cognitive reserve seems to offset the deleterious effect of both pathologies on the cognitive trajectories.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine the prevalence of elder abuse in the city of Pasto, Colombia and its association with sociodemographic and family factors. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study of primary information source obtained from surveys was conducted. The sample consisted of 506 elder adults selected by probabilistic sampling, by conglomerate, two-stage. The Geriatric Abuse Scale was used for the detection of abuse. Descriptive statistics were obtained by performing univariate analyses. Bivariate and multivariate analyses by binary logistic regression were conducted to identify associated factors. Results: The prevalence of abuse was 13{\%} and the most reported typology was psychological (5.4{\%}). The main factors associated with abuse were dependence, severe dysfunctionality, family member maltreatment and poor social support. Conclusion: Abuse of elderly adults is high due to specific behaviors that are present within families. The deterioration in social and family relationships of elder adults are factors that increase the abuse in old age. For this reason, support networks must be strengthened to support the elderly population.},

abstract = {Older adults were tested on a verbal working memory task that used the item-recognition paradigm. On some trials of this task, response-conflict was created by presenting test-items that were familiar but were not members of a current set of items stored in memory. These items required a negative response, but their familiarity biased subjects toward a positive response. Younger subjects show an interference effect on such trials, and this interference is accompanied by activation of a region of left lateral prefrontal cortex. However, there has been no evidence that the activation in this region is causally related to the interference that the subjects exhibit. In the present study, we demonstrate that older adults show more behavioral interference than younger subjects on this task, and they also show no reliable activation at the same lateral prefrontal site. This leads to the conclusion that this prefrontal site is functionally involved in mediating resolution among conflicting responses or among conflicting representations in working memory.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved. Background: The incidence of dementia is projected to rise over the coming decades, but with no sensitive diagnostic tests available. Vascular pathology precedes the deposition of amyloid and is an attractive early target. Objective: The aim of this review was to investigate the use of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation as a novel biomarker for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), focusing on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methods: 2,698 articles were identified from Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, and Web of Science databases. 306 articles were screened and quality assessed independently by two reviewers; 26 met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were performed for each marker with two or more studies and limited heterogeneity. Results: Eleven studies were TCD, 8 NIRS, 5 magnetic resonance imaging, and 2 positron/single photon emission tomography. Meta-analyses showed reduced tissue oxygenation index, cerebral blood flow and velocity, with higher pulsatility index, phase and cerebrovascular resistance in MCI compared to controls. The majority of studies found reduced CO 2 reactivity in MCI, with mixed findings in neuroactivation studies. Conclusion: Despite small sample sizes and heterogeneity, meta-analyses demonstrate clear abnormalities in cerebral hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters, even at an early stage of cognitive decline. Further work is required to investigate the use of cerebral hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters as a sensitive biomarker for dementia.},

abstract = {In a total of 10 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type (DAT) and in 10 healthy controls near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a new non-invasive optical method, was used to measure the changes of concentrations of oxy- (O2HB) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHB) in left and right hemispheric prefrontal brain tissue areas during performance of the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT). On a neuropsychological level, the healthy subjects performed better in the VFT than patients with DAT. Statistical analysis of the relative concentrations of O2HB and HHB measured with NIRS during performance of the VFT revealed a significant interaction of the hemispheric effects with the diagnosis. A possible interpretation of this finding is that a good performance in the VFT relies on a predominantly left hemispheric activation observed in controls, whereas a low number of correct responses is associated with a loss of this asymmetric activation in patients with DAT. Although both, patients and controls, performed better in the category version of the VFT, the metabolic effects of this task were significantly less pronounced than in the letter version. This indicates that different energy demands, according to the type of access to the memory stores, may be interpreted as the result of a less energy-demanding access to categorically stored information and adds further evidence to the view that memory departments in humans are organized according to categorical principles.},

abstract = {Aims: Excessive arterial pulsatility may contribute to cognitive decline and risk of dementia via damage to the fragile cerebral microcirculation. We hypothesized that the intensity of downstream-Travelling pulsatile waves measured by wave intensity analysis in the common carotid artery during mid-to late-life would be associated with subsequent cognitive decline. Methods and results: Duplex Doppler ultrasound was used to calculate peak forward-Travelling compression wave intensity (FCWI) within the common carotid artery in 3191 individuals [mean ± standard deviation (SD), age = 61 ± 6 years; 75{\%} male] assessed as part of the Whitehall II study in 2003-05. Serial measures of cognitive function were taken between 2002-04 and 2015-16. The relationship between FCWI and cognitive decline was adjusted for sociodemographic variables, genetic and health-related risk factors, and health behaviours. Mean (SD) 10-year change in standardized global cognitive score was-0.39 (0.18). Higher FCWI at baseline was associated with accelerated cognitive decline during follow-up [difference in 10-year change of global cognitive score per 1 SD higher FCWI =-0.02 (95{\%} confidence interval-0.04 to-0.00); P = 0.03]. This association was largely driven by cognitive changes in individuals with the highest FCWI [Q4 vs. Q1-Q3 =-0.05 (-0.09 to-0.01), P = 0.01], equivalent to an age effect of 1.9 years. Compared to other participants, this group was ∼50{\%} more likely to exhibit cognitive decline (defined as the top 15{\%} most rapid reductions in cognitive function during follow-up) even after adjustments for multiple potential confounding factors [odds ratio 1.49 (1.17-1.88)]. Conclusion: Elevated carotid artery wave intensity in mid-to late-life predicts faster cognitive decline in long-Term follow-up independent of other cardiovascular risk factors.},

Here, we review the cellular and molecular mechanisms in cerebral blood vessels and the pathophysiological events leading to cerebral blood flow dysregulation and disruption of the neurovascular unit and the blood-brain barrier, which all may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Particularly, we examine the link between neurovascular dysfunction and neurodegeneration including the effects of AD genetic risk factors on cerebrovascular functions and clearance of Alzheimer's amyloid-$\beta$ peptide toxin, and the impact of vascular risk factors, environment, and lifestyle on cerebral blood vessels, which in turn may affect synaptic, neuronal, and cognitive functions. Finally, we examine potential experimental treatments for dementia and AD based on the neurovascular model, and discuss some critical questions to be addressed by future studies.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare lung mechanics in infants treated with multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids with those in matched control infants delivered {\textgreater}7 days from dosing and those of matched untreated infants. STUDY DESIGN: Eighteen infants who received multiple courses of corticosteroids and were delivered within 7 days of dosing were matched with 18 infants who received 1 course of corticosteroids {\textgreater}7 days before delivery (remote) and 18 untreated infants. Respiratory compliance and functional residual capacity were measured within 36 hours. Differences were compared by analysis of variance. RESULTS: Infant demographics were similar. Respiratory compliance was higher in the multiple-course group than in the remote or untreated group (P {\textless} .02). Functional residual capacity was higher in the multiple-course group than in the untreated group (P {\textless} .05) but similar to that found in the remote group. CONCLUSION: Babies delivered after multiple courses of corticosteroids and within 7 days of dosing demonstrated improved respiratory compliance compared with untreated and remotely treated infants. This suggests that the enzyme system responsible for surfactant production can be repetitively induced despite prior treatment with corticosteroids. The increased functional residual capacity in remotely treated infants may reflect a maturation of lung architecture independent of surfactant production.},

abstract = {Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images-two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets-consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.},

abstract = {Statistical mapping within a binary hypothesis testing framework is the most widely used analytical method in functional MRI of the brain. A common assumption in this kind of analysis is that the fMRI time series are independent and identically distributed in time, yet we know that fMRI data can have significant temporal correlation due to low-frequency physiological fluctuation (Weisskoff et al. [1993]; Proc Soc Magn Reson Med 9:7; Biswal et al. [1995]: Mag Resort Med 34:537-541). Furthermore, since the signal-to- noise ratio will vary with imaging rate, we should expect that the degree of correlation will vary with imaging rate. In this paper, we investigate the effect of temporal correlation and experimental paradigm on false-positive rates (type I error rates), using data synthesized through a simple autoregressive plus white-noise model whose parameters were estimated from real data over a range of imaging rates. We demonstrate that actual false- positive rates can be biased far above or below the assumed significance level $\alpha$ when temporal autocorrelation is ignored in a way that depends on both the degree of correlation as well as the paradigm frequency. Furthermore, we present a simple method, based on the noise model described above, for correcting such distortions, and relate this method to the extended general linear model of Worsley and Friston ([1995]: Neuroimage 2:173-181).},

abstract = {Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the Somnotouch-NIBP noninvasive continuous blood pressure monitor according to the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol revision 2010. Materials and methods: Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were sequentially measured in 33 adults (11 women, mean age 63.5+/-11.9 years) using a mercury sphygmomanometer (two observers) and the Somnotouch-NIBP device (one supervisor). A total of 99 pairs of comparisons were obtained from 33 participants for judgments in two parts with three grading phases. Results: All the validation requirements were fulfilled. The Somnotouch-NIBP device fulfilled the requirements of the part 1 of the validation study. The number of absolute differences between device and observers within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg was 75/99, 90/99, and 96/99, respectively, for systolic blood pressure and 90/99, 99/99, and 99/99, respectively, for diastolic blood pressure. The device also fulfilled the criteria in part 2 of the validation study. Twenty-seven and 31 participants had at least two of the three device-observers differences less than or equal to 5 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. All three device-observer differences were greater than 5 mmHg in two participants for systolic and in one participant for diastolic blood pressure. Conclusion: The Somnotouch-NIBP noninvasive continuous blood pressure monitor has passed the requirements of the International Protocol revision 2010, and hence can be recommended for blood pressure monitoring in adults, at least under conditions corresponding to those investigated in our study.},

abstract = {Objective: We have shown that almost 50{\%} of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) will demonstrate cognitive impairment. Recent evidence has suggested that cerebral hypoperfusion is an important cause of cognitive impairment. Carotid stenosis can restrict blood flow to the brain, with consequent cerebral hypoperfusion. In contrast, cross-hemispheric collateral compensation through the Circle of Willis, and cerebrovascular vasodilation can also mitigate the effects of flow restriction. It is, therefore, critical to develop a clinically relevant measure of net brain perfusion in patients with ACS that could help in risk stratification and in determining the appropriate treatment. To determine whether ACS results in cerebral hypoperfusion, we developed a novel approach to quantify interhemispheric cerebral perfusion differences, measured as the time to peak (TTP) and mean transit time (MTT) delays using perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) of the whole brain. To evaluate the utility of using clinical duplex ultrasonography (DUS) to infer brain perfusion, we also assessed the relationship between the PWI findings and ultrasound-based peak systolic velocity (PSV). Methods: Structural and PWI of the brain and magnetic resonance angiography of the carotid arteries were performed in 20 patients with ≥70{\%} ACS. DUS provided the PSV, and magnetic resonance angiography provided plaque geometric measures at the stenosis. Volumetric perfusion maps of the entire brain from PWI were analyzed to obtain the mean interhemispheric differences for the TTP and MTT delays. In addition, the proportion of brain volume that demonstrated a delay in TTP and MTT was also measured. These proportions were measured for increasing severity of perfusion delays (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 seconds). Finally, perfusion asymmetries on PWI were correlated with the PSV and stenosis features on DUS using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Results: Of the 20 patients, 18 had unilateral stenosis (8 right and 10 left) and 2 had bilateral stenoses. The interhemispheric (left–right) TTP delays measured for the whole brain volume identified impaired perfusion in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stenosis in 16 of the 18 patients. More than 45{\%} of the patients had had ischemia in at least one half of their brain volume, with a TTP delay {\textgreater}0.5 second. The TTP and MTT delays showed strong correlations with PSV. In contrast, the correlations with the percentage of stenosis were weaker. The correlations for the PSV were strongest with the perfusion deficits (TTP and MTT delays) measured for the whole brain using our proposed algorithm (r = 0.80 and r = 0.74, respectively) rather than when measured on a single magnetic resonance angiography slice as performed in current clinical protocols (r = 0.31 and r = 0.58, respectively). Conclusions: Interhemispheric TTP and MTT delay measured for the whole brain using PWI has provided a new tool for assessing cerebral perfusion deficits in patients with ACS. Carotid stenosis was associated with a detectable reduction in ipsilateral brain perfusion compared with the opposite hemisphere in {\textgreater}80{\%} of patients. The PSV measured at the carotid stenosis using ultrasonography correlated with TTP and MTT delays and might serve as a clinically useful surrogate to brain hypoperfusion in these patients.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose. Intimal-medial thickening (IMT) of the carotid wall is an accepted peripheral marker of atherosclerosis. It is associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction and stroke, and lower attention-executive-psychomotor functioning. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between IMT and brain activity during a verbal working memory (VWM) task in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods. Thirteen CVD patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a 2-Back VWM task, and B-mode ultrasound of the carotid arteries. IMT was calculated using an automated algorithm based on a validated edge-detection technique. The relationship between IMT and 2-Back-related brain activity was modeled using partial correlations controlling for age and small vessel disease as measured by white matter signal hyperintensities on MRI (WMH). Results. Higher IMT was associated with lower 2-Back-related signal intensity and in the right middle frontal gyrus, independent of age and WMH. Conclusions. IMT may be one mechanism contributing to brain dysfunction in CVD. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast appears to be highly sensitive to peripheral vascular health as measured by IMT. Future studies should examine the sensitivity and specificity of the BOLD response for predicting cognitive decline in CVD. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.},

abstract = {Statistical mapping within a binary hypothesis testing framework is the most widely used analytical method in functional MRI of the brain. A common assumption in this kind of analysis is that the fMRI time series are independent and identically distributed in time, yet we know that fMRI data can have significant temporal correlation due to low-frequency physiological fluctuation (Weisskoff et al. [1993]; Proc Soc Magn Reson Med 9:7; Biswal et al. [1995]: Mag Resort Med 34:537-541). Furthermore, since the signal-to- noise ratio will vary with imaging rate, we should expect that the degree of correlation will vary with imaging rate. In this paper, we investigate the effect of temporal correlation and experimental paradigm on false-positive rates (type I error rates), using data synthesized through a simple autoregressive plus white-noise model whose parameters were estimated from real data over a range of imaging rates. We demonstrate that actual false- positive rates can be biased far above or below the assumed significance level $\alpha$ when temporal autocorrelation is ignored in a way that depends on both the degree of correlation as well as the paradigm frequency. Furthermore, we present a simple method, based on the noise model described above, for correcting such distortions, and relate this method to the extended general linear model of Worsley and Friston ([1995]: Neuroimage 2:173-181).},

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is used to measure cerebral activity because it is simple and portable. However, scalp-hemodynamics often contaminates fNIRS signals, leading to detection of cortical activity in regions that are actually inactive. Methods for removing these artifacts using standard source–detector distance channels (Long-channel) tend to over-estimate the artifacts, while methods using additional short source–detector distance channels (Short-channel) require numerous probes to cover broad cortical areas, which leads to a high cost and prolonged experimental time. Here, we propose a new method that effectively combines the existing techniques, preserving the accuracy of estimating cerebral activity and avoiding the disadvantages inherent when applying the techniques individually. Our new method accomplishes this by estimating a global scalp-hemodynamic component from a small number of Short-channels, and removing its influence from the Long-channels using a general linear model (GLM). To demonstrate the feasibility of this method, we collected fNIRS and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements during a motor task. First, we measured changes in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (∆ Oxy-Hb) from 18 Short-channels placed over motor-related areas, and confirmed that the majority of scalp-hemodynamics was globally consistent and could be estimated from as few as four Short-channels using principal component analysis. We then measured ∆ Oxy-Hb from 4 Short- and 43 Long-channels. The GLM identified cerebral activity comparable to that measured separately by fMRI, even when scalp-hemodynamics exhibited substantial task-related modulation. These results suggest that combining measurements from four Short-channels with a GLM provides robust estimation of cerebral activity at a low cost.},

Hemodynamics of these patients differed at rest, with 33{\%} fewer network links in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stenosis than the healthy hemisphere. On the other hand, hemodynamic patterns were more heterogeneous with patients diagnosed with a carotid occlusion, which correlates with the opening of collateral circulation.

abstract = {As near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) broadens its application area to different age and disease groups, motion artifacts in the NIRS signal due to subject movement is becoming an important challenge. Motion artifacts generally produce signal fluctuations that are larger than physiological NIRS signals, thus it is crucial to correct for them before obtaining an estimate of stimulus evoked hemodynamic responses. There are various methods for correction such as principle component analysis (PCA), wavelet-based filtering and spline interpolation. Here, we introduce a new approach to motion artifact correction, targeted principle component analysis (tPCA), which incorporates a PCA filter only on the segments of data identified as motion artifacts. It is expected that this will overcome the issues of filtering desired signals that plagues standard PCA filtering of entire data sets. We compared the new approach with the most effective motion artifact correction algorithms on a set of data acquired simultaneously with a collodion-fixed probe (low motion artifact content) and a standard Velcro probe (high motion artifact content). Our results show that tPCA gives statistically better results in recovering hemodynamic response function (HRF) as compared to wavelet-based filtering and spline interpolation for the Velcro probe. It results in a significant reduction in mean-squared error (MSE) and significant enhancement in Pearson's correlation coefficient to the true HRF. The collodion-fixed fiber probe with no motion correction performed better than the Velcro probe corrected for motion artifacts in terms of MSE and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Thus, if the experimental study permits, the use of a collodion-fixed fiber probe may be desirable. If the use of a collodion-fixed probe is not feasible, then we suggest the use of tPCA in the processing of motion artifact contaminated data. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {SpineLab is a software tool developed for reconstructing neuronal feature skeletons from three- dimensional single- or multi-photon image stacks. These images often suffer from limited resolution and a low signal-to-noise ratio, making the extraction of morphometric information difficult. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a software tool that offers the possibility to create feature skeletons in various modes— automatically as well as with manual interaction. We have named this novel tool SpineLab. In a first step, an inves- tigator adjusts a set of parameters for automatic analysis in an interactive manner, i.e., with online visual feedback, followed by a second step, in which the neuronal feature skeleton can be modified by hand. We validate the ability of SpineLab to reconstruct the entire dendritic tree of identified GFP-expressing neurons and evaluate the accuracy of dendritic spine detection. We report that SpineLab is capable of significantly facilitating the reconstruction of dendrites and spines. Moreover, the automatic approach appears sufficient to detect spine density changes in time- lapse imaging experiments. Taken together, we conclude that SpineLab is an ideal software tool for partially auto- matic reconstruction of neural cell morphology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) enables the non-invasive measurement of changes in hemodynamics and oxygenation in tissue. Changes in light-coupling due to movement of the subject can cause movement artifacts (MAs) in the recorded signals. Several methods have been developed so far that facilitate the detection and reduction of MAs in the data. However, due to fixed parameter values (e.g., global threshold) none of these methods are perfectly suitable for long-term (i.e., hours) recordings or were not $\backslash$r$\backslash$ntime-effective when applied to large datasets. We aimed to overcome these limitations by automation, i.e., data adaptive thresholding specifically designed for long-term measurements, and by introducing a stable long-term signal reconstruction. Our new technique (“acceleration-based movement artifact reduction algorithm”, AMARA) is based on combining two methods: the “movement artifact reduction algorithm” (MARA, Scholkmann et al. Phys. Meas. 2010, 31, 649–662), and the “accelerometer-based motion artifact removal” (ABAMAR, Virtanen et al. J. Biomed. Opt. 2011, 16, 087005). We describe AMARA in detail and report about successful validation of the algorithm using empirical NIRS data, measured over the prefrontal cortex in adolescents during sleep. In addition, we compared the performance of AMARA to that of MARA and ABAMAR based on validation data.},

abstract = {The associations between macrovascular and microvascular responses reported previously during post-occlusive reactive hyperemia have been inconsistent. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the temporal relationship between the reactive hyperemic responses within a conduit artery and the downstream microvessels. Conduit artery blood flow was measured in the brachial artery with pulsed Doppler ultrasound. A potential analog of microvascular flow, changes in skeletal muscle total[hemoglobin+myoglobin] (T[Hb+Mb]), was assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We found a high degree of correlation between these two measures (r=0.91). Cross-correlation analysis revealed two distinct response patterns. In 10 of our 15 subjects there was time displacement between peak brachial artery blood flow (BABF) and T[Hb+Mb] responses; in the remaining 5 the peaks were coincident. Granger causality testing suggested that reactive hyperemia in the macrovessel determined hyperemia in the downstream microvessels in all 15 study subjects. Time constants for the on ($\tau$1) and off ($\tau$2) kinetics of each response were calculated; our initial hypothesis was that $\tau$1 and $\tau$2 for T[Hb+Mb] would correlate with $\tau$1 and $\tau$2 for BABF, respectively. However, only for $\tau$2 was this observed (r=0.52; p{\textless}0.05). No similar relationship was observed for $\tau$1. Adipose tissue thickness did not influence either time constant for T[Hb+Mb]. Taken together, our results show that the temporal characteristics of the hyperemic response in the conduit artery are qualitatively reflected in the downstream microvasculature, but mechanisms for quantitative differences remain to be identified. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

No general method is yet available to reduce these MAs effectively. The aim was to develop a new MA reduction method. A method based on moving standard deviation and spline interpolation was developed. It enables the semi-automatic detection and reduction of MAs in the data. It was validated using simulated and real NIRI signals. The results show that a significant reduction of MAs and an increase in signal quality are achieved. The effectiveness and usability of the method is demonstrated by the improved detection of evoked hemodynamic responses. The present method can not only be used in the postprocessing of NIRI signals but also for other kinds of data containing artifacts, for example ECG or EEG signals.},

A positive correlation was observed between age and Stroop-related activation (n = 30) in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, the left anterior cingulate, and the left parietal and parieto-occipital cortices. No regions showed a negative correlation between activation and age. We further investigated age-related differences by stratifying the sample into three age groups: children (ages 7-11), adolescents (ages 12-16), and young adults (ages 18-22). Young adult subjects (n = 11) displayed significant activation in the inferior and middle frontal gyri bilaterally, the left anterior cingulate, and bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobules. Between-group comparisons revealed that young adults had significantly greater activation than adolescent subjects (n = 11) in the left middle frontal gyrus and that young adults showed significantly greater activation than children (n = 8) in the anterior cingulate and left parietal and parieto-occipital regions, as well as in the left middle frontal gyrus. Compared to children, both adult and adolescent subjects exhibited significantly greater activation in the parietal cortex. Adult and adolescent groups, however, did not differ in activation for this region. Together, these data suggest that Stroop task-related functional development of the parietal lobe occurs by adolescence. In contrast, prefrontal cortex function contributing to the Stroop interference task continues to develop into adulthood. This neuromatu-rational process may depend on increased ability to recruit focal neural resources with age. Findings from this study, the first developmental fMRI investigation of the Stroop interference task, provide a template with which normal development and neurodevelopmental disorders of prefrontal cortex function can be assessed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

The present article examines a variant of a TMT (called the Connections Test) that attempts to remedy these deficiencies. A structural equation model suggested that there were no direct effects of age on either the nonalternating or alternating versions of the Connections Test (analogous to TMT Versions A and B, respectively); rather, all age- related effects were mediated through effects on perceptual speed. Moreover, although the nonalternating and alternating versions were strongly related to one another, only the latter had significant independent relations with measures of higher order cognition.},

METHOD: Participants were cognitively intact, healthy adults who completed genotyping, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and structural and functional neuroimaging. Twenty-two participants had the APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype, and 13 participants had the APOE epsilon3/epsilon4 genotype. The study employed an auditory verbal N-back task to probe working memory-related brain activity. RESULTS: The epsilon3/epsilon3 and epsilon3/epsilon4 groups did not differ in demographic characteristics, cognitive ability, mood, or in-scanner task performance. The epsilon3/epsilon4 group showed greater activity during working memory in the medial frontal and parietal regions bilaterally and in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There were no regions in which the epsilon3/epsilon3 group showed greater activation than the epsilon3/epsilon4 group. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that differences in brain activity are evident in cognitively intact individuals who are at risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease by virtue of their APOE allele status. As neuroprotective interventions become available, early detection will increase in importance. The combination of genetic and functional neuroimaging strategies may prove useful for monitoring individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease before the onset of cognitive symptoms.},

abstract = {Accumulated evidence suggests the involvement of vascular factors in late-onset depression. Late-onset depression has characteristics of poor outcome, cognitive decline, and high prevalence rather than early-onset depression. The aim of the present study was to determine whether or not the functional hypofrontality-that is, hypoperfusion and hypometabolism in the frontal lobes-seen in late-onset depression is a trait-dependent abnormality of microvascular regulation. This study was conducted on 10 patients with remitted late-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) and 10 healthy volunteers matched for vascular factors and subcortical, or white matter, hyperintensities (WMH). Using near-infrared spectroscopy combined with magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the microvascular reactivity in the prefrontal cortex during a cognitive task and during carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation. Activation of the prefrontal cortex during the cognitive task was significantly less in patients as compared with controls, although task performance was not significantly different between the two groups. In the patients, a tendency of negative correlation between the reduced prefrontal activation during a cognitive task and the severity of hyperintensity in periventricular region was observed. Vasomotor reactivity to CO2 inhalation was significantly lower in the patients than in the controls. Although there was no significant association between the activation during the cognitive and that during the CO2 inhalation task, the present results suggest that prefrontal microvascular dysregulation as shown by NIRS is involved in the pathophysiological basis of functional hypofrontality in late-onset depression. This finding will provide a new framework for the development of diagnostic methods, treatments, and preventive strategies against late-onset depression. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The progression of cognitive and motor functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy aged individuals was studied. For the healthy aged, the progress was negligible during a 2‐year period. In the AD patients, there was a marked progression in all cognitive tests, but only a slight progression in the finger motor tests. Progression rate varied substantially across functions; the most rapid progression was seen in psychomotor speed, whereas the slowest was seen in episodic memory. The onset of decline was estimated to have occurred first in episodic memory, then in psychomotor speed, semantic memory, and visuospatial functions; finally and most recently, decline was estimated to have occurred in primary memory. The overall data pattern suggests that the onset as well as the rate of progression varies across cognitive functions, and that there may be a time‐ordered sequence of decline of neuropsychological functions in AD that parallels the trajectory of neuropathological changes in this disease.

abstract = {Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) allows the recovery of the evoked hemodynamic response to brain activation. In adult human populations, the NIRS signal is strongly contaminated by systemic interference occurring in the superficial layers of the head. An approach to overcome this difficulty is to use additional NIRS measurements with short optode separations to measure the systemic hemodynamic fluctuations occurring in the superficial layers. These measurements can then be used as regressors in the post-experiment analysis to remove the systemic contamination and isolate the brain signal. In our previous work, we showed that the systemic interference measured in NIRS is heterogeneous across the surface of the scalp. As a consequence, the short separation measurement used in the regression procedure must be located close to the standard NIRS channel from which the evoked hemodynamic response of the brain is to be recovered. Here, we demonstrate that using two short separation measurements, one at the source optode and one at the detector optode, further increases the performance of the short separation regression method compared to using a single short separation measurement. While a single short separation channel produces an average reduction in noise of 33{\%} for HbO, using a short separation channel at both source and detector reduces noise by 59{\%} compared to the standard method using a general linear model (GLM) without short separation. For HbR, noise reduction of 3{\%} is achieved using a single short separation and this number goes to 47{\%} when two short separations are used. Our work emphasizes the importance of integrating short separation measurements both at the source and at the detector optode of the standard channels from which the hemodynamic response is to be recovered. While the implementation of short separation sources presents some difficulties experimentally, the improvement in noise reduction is significant enough to justify the practical challenges. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 SPIE. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has potential to offer a fast and non-invasive method of assessing cerebral saturation in a clinical setting, however, there are concerns that NIRS brain measures suffer contamination from superficial tissues. This study used the Valsalva manoeuver (VM) to determine whether NIRS could differentiate between superficial (from somatic tissue) and neurological changes in the context of traumatic brain injury. A potent vasopressor was used to assess the effect of reducing total haemoglobin concentration in the superficial regions of the forehead. Frequency domain NIRS measurements during the VM pre and post vasoconstrictor injection, combined with simulation data, conclusively show that NIRS can detect neurological changes, in both haemoglobin content and saturation, when positioned on the forehead. The effect of superficial contamination in this instance appeared to be insignificant, with no statistically significant change in saturation over 8 patients, even with a drop in superficial haemoglobin concentration due to the vasoconstrictor, confirmed by laser Doppler. Nevertheless, simulations indicated that the absolute values of the recovered NIRS parameters are not quantitatively accurate; however a direct comparison with invasive measures is needed to confirm this.},

abstract = {Background Metabolic syndrome (MetS) - a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors - is linked with cognitive decline and dementia. However, the brain changes underlying this link are presently unknown. In this study, we tested the relationship between MetS, cerebral blood flow (CBF), white matter hyperintensity burden, and gray matter (GM) volume in cognitively healthy late middle-aged adults. Additionally, the extent to which MetS was associated with cognitive performance was assessed. Design and Methods Late middle-aged adults from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (N = 69, mean age = 60.4 years) underwent a fasting blood draw, arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI, T1-weighted MRI, T2FLAIR MRI, and neuropsychological testing. MetS was defined as abnormalities on three or more factors, including abdominal obesity, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting glucose. Results Mean GM CBF was 15{\%} lower in MetS compared to controls. Voxel-wise image analysis indicated that the MetS group had lower CBF across a large portion of the cortical surface, with the exception of medial and inferior parts of the occipital and temporal lobes. The MetS group also had lower immediate memory function; a mediation analysis indicated this relationship was partially mediated by CBF. Among the MetS factors, abdominal obesity and elevated triglycerides were most strongly associated with lower CBF. Conclusions The results underscore the importance of reducing the number of cardiovascular risk factors for maintaining CBF and cognition in an aging population.

@article{Friston2002,
abstract = {In Friston et al. ((2002) Neuroimage 16: 465-483) we introduced empirical Bayes as a potentially useful way to estimate and make inferences about effects in hierarchical models. In this paper we present a series of models that exemplify the diversity of problems that can be addressed within this framework. In hierarchical linear observation models, both classical and empirical Bayesian approaches can be framed in terms of covariance component estimation (e.g., variance partitioning). To illustrate the use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in covariance component estimation we focus first on two important problems in fMRI: nonsphericity induced by (i) serial or temporal correlations among errors and (ii) variance components caused by the hierarchical nature of multisubject studies. In hierarchical observation models, variance components at higher levels can be used as constraints on the parameter estimates of lower levels. This enables the use of parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) estimators, as distinct from classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. We develop this distinction to address: (i) The difference between response estimates based on ML and the conditional means from a Bayesian approach and the implications for estimates of intersubject variability. (ii) The relationship between fixed- and random-effect analyses. (iii) The specificity and sensitivity of Bayesian inference and, finally, (iv) the relative importance of the number of scans and subjects. The forgoing is concerned with within- and between-subject variability in multisubject hierarchical fMRI studies. In the second half of this paper we turn to Bayesian inference at the first (within-voxel) level, using PET data to show how priors can be derived from the (between-voxel) distribution of activations over the brain. This application uses exactly the same ideas and formalism but, in this instance, the second level is provided by observations over voxels as opposed to subjects. The ensuing posterior probability maps (PPMs) have enhanced anatomical precision and greater face validity, in relation to underlying anatomy. Furthermore, in comparison to conventional SPMs they are not confounded by the multiple comparison problem that, in a classical context, dictates high thresholds and low sensitivity. We conclude with some general comments on Bayesian approaches to image analysis and on some unresolved issues. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {Cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is being debated whether this reflects diminished demand because of advanced neurodegeneration or that cerebral hypoperfusion contributes to dementia. We examined the relation of CBF velocity as measured with transcranial Doppler with dementia and markers of incipient dementia (ie, cognitive decline and hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging) in 1,730 participants of the Rotterdam Study aged 55 years and older. Cognitive decline in the 6.5 years preceding CBF velocity measurement was assessed with repeated Mini-Mental State Examinations in nondemented subjects (n = 1,716). Hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were assessed in a subset of 170 nondemented subjects. Subjects with greater CBF velocity were less likely to have dementia. Furthermore, in nondemented subjects, greater CBF velocity was related to significantly less cognitive decline over the preceding period (odds ratio per standard deviation increase in mean CBF 0.74 [95{\%} confidence interval, 0.58-0.98]) and larger hippocampal and amygdalar volumes. A low CBF is associated with dementia, but also with markers of incipient dementia. Although we cannot exclude that this is caused by preclinical neurodegeneration leading to hypoperfusion, it does suggest that cerebral hypoperfusion precedes and possibly contributes to onset of clinical dementia. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Neurological Association.},

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that pressure and flow in the arteries are purely the result of forward and backward travelling waves. We will show that various observations of arterial behaviour are difficult to explain using this assumption. In particular we will look at what happens to arterial pressure under different conditions: during ectopic beats, in experimental studies of pressure and flow when the aorta is totally occluded at different locations, in a computational study of the input impedances of randomly generated networks of arteries and when pressure and velocity are measured at different distances along the aorta. We show that all of these observations can be explained using wave intensity analysis. We further show that this analysis suggests that it is useful to separate arterial pressure into a reservoir pressure that accounts for the overall compliance of the arterial system and an excess pressure that is determined by local conditions. Evidence has accumulated in the decade since the introduction of the reservoir-wave hypothesis that the reservoir/excess pressure separation can be useful in interpreting the results of vasoactive drugs on cardiovascular performance and that parameters based on the reservoir/excess pressure are significant predictors of cardiovascular events. The important question that remains to be answered is the usefulness of the concept in the interpretation, physiologically and clinically, of the complex behaviour of the cardiovascular system. We conclude that the evidence suggests that it is a worthwhile topic for future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.},

abstract = {Aging reduces cerebral blood flow in association cortices during rest. However, the influence of age on functional brain activation is still controversial. The aim of our study was to examine age dependency of brain activation in primary and association cortices. Therefore, changes in the concentration of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin as well as changes in the redox state of cytochrome-c-oxidase (Cyt-Ox) were measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in the lateral prefrontal and motor cortices during an event-related Stroop interference task. Fourteen young (23.9 ± 3.1 years old) and 14 elderly subjects (65.1 ± 3.1) participated in the study. Data revealed two effects of aging on brain activation: (1) Elderly and young subjects used the lateral prefrontal cortex to cope with interference during the Stroop task. In young subjects, the vascular response was higher during incongruent than neutral trials in the entire examined lateral prefrontal cortex. However, in the elderly, all lateral prefrontal regions showed a hemodynamic response but not necessarily a specific interference effect. (2) The hemodynamic response was reduced in elderly subjects in the lateral prefrontal association cortex, but obviously not in the motor cortex. We propose that calculating effect sizes is the only reliable approach to analyze age-related effects in fNIRS studies, because they are independent from the assumed differential pathlength factor. In summary, our findings suggest that aging decreases the hemodynamic response in the frontal association cortex during functional activation, omitting the primary motor cortex. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) research articles show a large heterogeneity in the analysis approaches and pre-processing procedures. Additionally, there is often a lack of a complete description of the methods applied, necessary for study replication or for results comparison. The aims of this paper were (i) to review and investigate which information is generally included in published fNIRS papers, and (ii) to define a signal pre-processing procedure to set a common ground for standardization guidelines. To this goal, we have reviewed 110 fNIRS articles published in 2016 in the field of cognitive neuroscience, and performed a simulation analysis with synthetic fNIRS data to optimize the signal filtering step before applying the GLM method for statistical inference. Our results highlight the fact that many papers lack important information, and there is a large variability in the filtering methods used. Our simulations demonstrated that the optimal approach to remove noise and recover the hemodynamic response from fNIRS data in a GLM framework is to use a 1000th order band-pass Finite Impulse Response filter. Based on these results, we give preliminary recommendations as to the first step toward improving the analysis of fNIRS data and dissemination of the results.},

abstract = {Background: The evidence base on the prevalence of dementia is expanding rapidly, particularly in countries with low and middle incomes. A reappraisal of global prevalence and numbers is due, given the significant implications for social and public policy and planning. Methods: In this study we provide a systematic review of the global literature on the prevalence of dementia (1980-2009) and metaanalysis to estimate the prevalence and numbers of those affected, aged ≥60 years in 21 Global Burden of Disease regions. Results: Age-standardized prevalence for those aged ≥60 years varied in a narrow band, 5{\%}-7{\%} in most world regions, with a higher prevalence in Latin America (8.5{\%}), and a distinctively lower prevalence in the four sub-Saharan African regions (2{\%}-4{\%}). It was estimated that 35.6 million people lived with dementia worldwide in 2010, with numbers expected to almost double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. In 2010, 58{\%} of all people with dementia lived in countries with low or middle incomes, with this proportion anticipated to rise to 63{\%} in 2030 and 71{\%} in 2050. Conclusion: The detailed estimates in this study constitute the best current basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources in dementia care. The age-specific prevalence of dementia varies little between world regions, and may converge further. Future projections of numbers of people with dementia may be modified substantially by preventive interventions (lowering incidence), improvements in treatment and care (prolonging survival), and disease-modifying interventions (preventing or slowing progression). All countries need to commission nationally representative surveys that are repeated regularly to monitor trends. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cerebral hemodynamics play a pivotal role in stroke pathogenesis. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) studies demonstrated the importance of cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) on the outcome of carotid artery occlusion (CAO). So far, positron emission tomography represents the best technique for detecting both hemodynamic and metabolic aspects of cerebral perfusion adaptive processes in cerebrovascular patients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a new method allowing for a non-invasive assessment of cerebral blood flow and hemoglobin (Hb) oxygenation parameters. A recent TCD and NIRS study demonstrated that patients with symptomatic CAO had lower VMR values measured by TCD and lower oxygen saturation (oxygen{\%}) increases detected by NIRS than asymptomatic ones. The parameters were obtained simultaneously after CO2 inhalation. The present study aims to investigate if Hb oxygen {\%} could represent also at rest a marker of hemodynamic status in carotid disease. Thirty-five symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic patients with CAO underwent a simultaneous examination by means of TCD and NIRS at rest condition and during CO2 reactivity test. Symptomatic patients presented with oxygen{\%} values at rest higher (p = 0.001) and VMR values lower (p {\textless} 0.001) than asymptomatic subjects. According to a logistic model, for each unitary VMR increase, the odds of being symptomatic decreases of about 10{\%} (OR = 0.9, p = 0.001); for each unitary increase of oxygen{\%} at baseline, this odd increases of about 23{\%} (OR = 1.23, p = 0.031). In addition to TCD VMR values, oxygen hemoglobin saturation at rest detected by NIRS can discriminate symptomatic from asymptomatic patients with CAO. NIRS can add an important contribution to explain pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke occurrence. {\textcopyright} 2006 Steinkopff Verlag Darmstadt.},

abstract = {Importance Evidence is limited regarding the relation between cardiovascular health level and dementia risk. Objective To investigate the association between cardiovascular health level, defined using the 7-item tool from the American Heart Association (AHA), and risk of dementia and cognitive decline in older persons. Design, Setting, and Participants Population-based cohort study of persons aged 65 years or older from Bordeaux, Dijon, and Montpellier, France, without history of cardiovascular diseases or dementia at baseline who underwent repeated in-person neuropsychological testing (January 1999–July 2016) and systematic detection of incident dementia (date of final follow-up, July 26, 2016). Exposures The number of the AHA's Life's Simple 7 metrics at recommended optimal level (nonsmoking, body mass index {\textless}25, regular physical activity, eating fish twice a week or more and fruits and vegetables at least 3 times a day, cholesterol {\textless}200 mg/dL [untreated], fasting glucose {\textless}100 mg/dL [untreated], and blood pressure {\textless}120/80 mm Hg [untreated]; score range, 0-7) and a global cardiovascular health score (range, 0-14; poor, intermediate, and optimal levels of each metric assigned a value of 0, 1, and 2, respectively). Main Outcomes and Measures Incident dementia validated by an expert committee and change in a composite score of global cognition (in standard units, with values indicating distance from population means, 0 equal to the mean, and +1 and −1 equal to 1 SD above and below the mean). Results Among 6626 participants (mean age, 73.7 years; 4200 women [63.4{\%}]), 2412 (36.5{\%}), 3781 (57.1{\%}), and 433 (6.5{\%}) had 0 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 to 7 health metrics at optimal levels, respectively, at baseline. Over a mean follow-up duration of 8.5 (range, 0.6-16.6) years, 745 participants had incident adjudicated dementia. Compared with the incidence rate of dementia of 1.76 (95{\%} CI, 1.38-2.15) per 100 person-years among those with 0 or 1 health metrics at optimal levels, the absolute differences in incident dementia rates for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to 7 metrics were, respectively, −0.26 (95{\%} CI, −0.48 to −0.04), −0.59 (95{\%} CI, −0.80 to −0.38), −0.43 (95{\%} CI, −0.65 to −0.21), −0.93 (95{\%} CI, −1.18 to −0.68), and −0.96 (95{\%} CI, −1.37 to −0.56) per 100 person-years. In multivariable models, the hazard ratios for dementia were 0.90 (95{\%} CI, 0.84-0.97) per additional optimal metric and 0.92 (95{\%} CI, 0.89-0.96) per additional point on the global score. Furthermore, the gain in global cognition associated with each additional optimal metric at baseline was 0.031 (95{\%} CI, 0.009-0.053) standard units at inclusion, 0.068 (95{\%} CI, 0.045-0.092) units at year 6, and 0.072 (95{\%} CI, 0.042-0.102) units at year 12. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort of older adults, increased numbers of optimal cardiovascular health metrics and a higher cardiovascular health score were associated with a lower risk of dementia and lower rates of cognitive decline. These findings may support the promotion of cardiovascular health to prevent risk factors associated with cognitive decline and dementia.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Background: Increasing age is the biggest risk factor for dementia, of which Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause. The pathological changes underpinning Alzheimer's disease are thought to develop at least a decade prior to the onset of symptoms. Molecular positron emission tomography and multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging allow key pathological processes underpinning cognitive impairment - including $\beta$-amyloid depostion, vascular disease, network breakdown and atrophy - to be assessed repeatedly and non-invasively. This enables potential determinants of dementia to be delineated earlier, and therefore opens a pre-symptomatic window where intervention may prevent the onset of cognitive symptoms. Methods/design: This paper outlines the clinical, cognitive and imaging protocol of "Insight 46", a neuroscience sub-study of the MRC National Survey of Health and Development. This is one of the oldest British birth cohort studies and has followed 5362 individuals since their birth in England, Scotland and Wales during one week in March 1946. These individuals have been tracked in 24 waves of data collection incorporating a wide range of health and functional measures, including repeat measures of cognitive function. Now aged 71years, a small fraction have overt dementia, but estimates suggest that {\~{}}1/3 of individuals in this age group may be in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. Insight 46 is recruiting 500 study members selected at random from those who attended a clinical visit at 60-64years and on whom relevant lifecourse data are available. We describe the sub-study design and protocol which involves a prospective two time-point (0, 24month) data collection covering clinical, neuropsychological, $\beta$-amyloid positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, biomarker and genetic information. Data collection started in 2015 (age 69) and aims to be completed in 2019 (age 73). Discussion: Through the integration of data on the socioeconomic environment and on physical, psychological and cognitive function from 0 to 69years, coupled with genetics, structural and molecular imaging, and intensive cognitive and neurological phenotyping, Insight 46 aims to identify lifetime factors which influence brain health and cognitive ageing, with particular focus on Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease. This will provide an evidence base for the rational design of disease-modifying trials.},

Women and blacks are critically understudied populations that carry a sizeable portion of the heart failure burden. Limited normative and prognostic data exist on measures of cardiac structure, diastolic function, and novel measures of systolic deformation in older adults living in the community. Methods and Results-The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is a large, predominantly biracial, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored epidemiological cohort study. Between 2011 and 2013, ̃6000 surviving participants, now in their seventh to ninth decade of life, are expected to return for a fifth study visit during which comprehensive 2-dimensional, Doppler, tissue Doppler, and speckle-tracking echocardiography will be performed uniformly in all cohort clinic visit participants. The following objectives will be addressed: (1) to characterize cardiac structural and functional abnormalities among the elderly and to determine how they differ by sex and race/ethnicity, (2) to determine the relationship between ventricular and vascular abnormalities, and (3) to prospectively examine the extent to which these noninvasive measures associate with incident heart failure. Conclusions-We describe the design, imaging acquisition and analysis methods, and quality assurance metrics for echocardiography in visit 5 of the ARIC cohort. A better understanding of the differences in cardiac structure and function through the spectrum of heart failure stages in elderly persons generally, and between sexes and racial/ethnic groups specifically, will deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology driving heart failure progression in these at-risk populations and may inform novel prevention or therapeutic strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method to measure brain activity via changes in the degree of hemoglobin oxygenation through the intact skull. As optically measured hemoglobin signals strongly correlate with BOLD signals, simultaneous measurement using NIRS and fMRI promises a significant mutual enhancement of temporal and spatial resolutions. Although there exists a powerful statistical parametric mapping tool in fMRI, current public domain statistical tools for NIRS have several limitations related to the quantitative analysis of simultaneous recording studies with fMRI. In this paper, a new public domain statistical toolbox known as NIRS-SPM is described. It enables the quantitative analysis of NIRS signal. More specifically, NIRS data are statistically analyzed based on the general linear model (GLM) and Sun's tube formula. The p-values are calculated as the excursion probability of an inhomogeneous random field on a representation manifold that is dependent on the structure of the error covariance matrix and the interpolating kernels. NIRS-SPM not only enables the calculation of activation maps of oxy-, deoxy-hemoglobin and total hemoglobin, but also allows for the super-resolution localization, which is not possible using conventional analysis tools. Extensive experimental results using finger tapping and memory tasks confirm the viability of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The severe dizziness group showed the most marked postural drop in CBV and BP and showed a drop in pulse rate after an initial increase during standing. Postural dizziness was unrelated to plasma levels of THC and other indices. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The vascular hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (VHAD) was proposed 24 years ago from observations made in our laboratory using aging rats subjected to chronic brain hypoperfusion. In recent years, VHAD has become a mother-lode to numerous neuroimaging studies targeting cerebral hemodynamic changes, particularly brain hypoperfusion in elderly patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is a growing consensus among neuroradiologists that brain hypoperfusion is likely involved in the pathogenesis of AD and that disturbed cerebral blood flow (CBF) can serve as a key biomarker for predicting conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD. The use of cerebral hypoperfusion as a preclinical predictor of AD is becoming decisive in stratifying low and high risk patients that may develop cognitive decline and for assessing the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. There is currently an international research drive from neuroimaging groups to seek new perspectives that can broaden our understanding of AD and improve lifestyle. Diverse neuroimaging methods are currently being used to monitor normal and dyscognitive brain activity. Some techniques are very powerful and can detect, diagnose, quantify, prognose, and predict cognitive decline before AD onset, even from a healthy cognitive state. Multimodal imaging offers new insights in the treatment and prevention of cognitive decline during advanced aging and better understanding of the functional and structural organization of the human brain. This review discusses the impact the VHAD and CBF are having on the neuroimaging technology that can usher practical strategies to help prevent AD.},

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an established optical neuroimaging method for measuring functional hemodynamic responses to infer neural activation. However, the impact of individual anatomy on the sensitivity of fNIRS measuring hemodynamics within cortical gray matter is still unknown. By means of Monte Carlo simulations and structural MRI of 23 healthy subjects (mean age: (25.0 ± 2.8) years), we characterized the individual distribution of tissue-specific NIR-light absorption underneath 24 prefrontal fNIRS channels. We, thereby, investigated the impact of scalp-cortex distance (SCD), frontal sinus volume as well as sulcal morphology on gray matter volumes (V gray) traversed by NIR-light, i.e. anatomy-dependent fNIRS sensitivity. The NIR-light absorption between optodes was distributed describing a rotational ellipsoid with a mean penetration depth of (23.6 ± 0.7)mm considering the deepest 5{\%} of light. Of the detected photon packages scalp and bone absorbed (96.4 ± 9.7){\%} and V gray absorbed (3.1 ± 1.8){\%} of the energy. The mean V gray volume (1.1 ± 0.4)cm 3 was negatively correlated (r= -.76) with the SCD and frontal sinus volume (r= -.57) and was reduced by 41.5{\%} in subjects with relatively large compared to small frontal sinus. Head circumference was significantly positively correlated with the mean SCD (r=.46) and the traversed frontal sinus volume (r=.43). Sulcal morphology had no significant impact on V gray. Our findings suggest to consider individual SCD and frontal sinus volume as anatomical factors impacting fNIRS sensitivity. Head circumference may represent a practical measure to partly control for these sources of error variance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Haeussinger et al.},

The main outcome measures were: (i) average ambulatory SBP measured on right and left arm simultaneously during 24 h, and (ii) estimate of WCE derived, by current practise, as the difference between the referral clinic BP (the higher of the manual readings from both arms) and ambulatory non-dominant arm BP, contrasted with the WCE calculated as the difference between clinic and ambulatory readings from the same arm (the arm with the higher manual readings). The supine referral clinic SBP was 16+/-6 mm Hg higher in the right compared with the left arm. Average 24 h ambulatory SBP was 6+/-7 mm Hg higher in the right arm (range +17 to -3 mm Hg), P = 0.025. Diastolic BP measurements mirrored the systolic findings. One-third of the WCE, estimated by current practise, could be attributed to inconsistency in the choice of arm for BP measurement. Thus, inconsistency in the selection of arms for BP measurement, by different techniques, may confound estimation of patients' cardiovascular morbidity risk.},

abstract = {The registration of functional brain data to common stereotaxic brain space facilitates data sharing and integration across different subjects, studies, and even imaging modalities. Thus, we previously described a method for the probabilistic registration of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data onto Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate space that can be used even when magnetic resonance images of the subjects are not available. This method, however, requires the careful measurement of scalp landmarks and fNIRS optode positions using a 3D-digitizer. Here we present a novel registration method, based on simulations in place of physical measurements for optode positioning. First, we constructed a holder deformation algorithm and examined its validity by comparing virtual and actual deformation of holders on spherical phantoms and real head surfaces. The discrepancies were negligible. Next, we registered virtual holders on synthetic heads and brains that represent size and shape variations among the population. The registered positions were normalized to MNI space. By repeating this process across synthetic heads and brains, we statistically estimated the most probable MNI coordinate values, and clarified errors, which were in the order of several millimeters across the scalp, associated with this estimation. In essence, the current method allowed the spatial registration of completely stand-alone fNIRS data onto MNI space without the use of supplementary measurements. This method will not only provide a practical solution to the spatial registration issues in fNIRS studies, but will also enhance cross-modal communications within the neuroimaging community. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Brain mapping data have been modeled as Gaussian random fields, and local increases in mean are detected by local maxima of a random field of test statistics derived from these data. Accurate p values for local maxima are readily available for isotropic data based on the expected Euler characteristic of the excursion set of the test statistic random field. In this article we give a simple method for dealing with nonisotropic data. Our approach has connections to the model of Sampson and Guttorp for nonisotropy in which there exists an unknown mapping of the support of the data to a space in which the random fields are isotropic. Heuristic justification for our approach comes from the Nash embedding theorem. Formally, we show that our method gives consistent unbiased estimators for the true p values based on new results of Taylor and Adler for random fields on manifolds, which replace the Euclidean metric by the variogram. The results are used to detect gender differences in the cortical thickness of the brain and to detect regions of the brain involved in sentence comprehension measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Statistical Association.},

The input-output characteristics of a hemodynamic response are modeled as an autoregressive moving average model together with exogenous physical signals (i.e., ARMAX). In contrast to the fixed design matrix in the conventional general linear model, the proposed model incorporates the temporal variations in the experimental paradigm as well as in the hemodynamics. The performance of the proposed method has been tested by using box-car type functions followed by individual tapping tasks. The results and their significance were verified using t-statistics indicating that ARMAX seems to be better able to track/reveal the hemodynamic response. Also, online brain-activation maps were generated for localizing brain activities. Experimental results are compared with those of the existing conventional GLM-based method. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: High left ventricular mass (LVM) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality, but information relating LVM in older age to growth in early life is limited. We assessed the relationship of birthweight, height and body mass index (BMI) and overweight across childhood and adolescence with later life left ventricular (LV) structure. Methods: We used data from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) on men and women born in 1946 in Britain and followed up ever since. We use regression models to relate prospective measures of birthweight and height and BMI from ages 2–20 years to LV structure at 60–64 years. Results: Positive associations of birthweight with LVM and LV end diastolic volume (LVEDV) at 60–64 years were largely explained by adult height. Higher BMI, greater changes in BMI and greater accumulation of overweight across childhood and adolescence were associated with higher LVM and LVEDV and odds of concentric hypertrophy. Those who were overweight at two ages in early life had a mean LVM 11.5 g (95{\%} confidence interval: -2.19,24.87) greater, and a mean LVEDV 10.0 ml (3.7,16.2) greater, than those who were not overweight. Associations were at least partially mediated through adult body mass index. Body size was less consistently associated with relative wall thickness (RWT), with the strongest association being observed with pubertal BMI change [0.007 (0.001,0.013) per standard deviation change in BMI 7–15 years]. The relationships between taller childhood height and LVM and LVEDV were explained by adult height. Conclusions: Given the increasing levels of overweight in contemporary cohorts of children, these findings further emphasize the need for effective interventions to prevent childhood overweight.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is susceptible to signal artifacts caused by relative motion between NIRS optical fibers and the scalp. These artifacts can be very damaging to the utility of functional NIRS, particularly in challenging subject groups where motion can be unavoidable. A number of approaches to the removal of motion artifacts from NIRS data have been suggested. In this paper we systematically compare the utility of a variety of published NIRS motion correction techniques using a simulated functional activation signal added to 20 real NIRS datasets which contain motion artifacts. Principle component analysis, spline interpolation, wavelet analysis, and Kalman filtering approaches are compared to one another and to standard approaches using the accuracy of the recovered, simulated hemodynamic response function (HRF). Each of the four motion correction techniques we tested yields a significant reduction in the mean-squared error (MSE) and significant increase in the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the recovered HRF when compared to no correction and compared to a process of rejecting motion-contaminated trials. Spline interpolation produces the largest average reduction in MSE (55{\%}) while wavelet analysis produces the highest average increase in CNR (39{\%}). On the basis of this analysis, we recommend the routine application of motion correction techniques (particularly spline interpolation or wavelet analysis) to minimize the impact of motion artifacts on functional NIRS data.},

For this purpose we provide an overview of the commercially available instruments and address instrumental aspects such as light sources, detectors and sensor arrangements. Methodological aspects, algorithms to calculate the concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and approaches for data analysis are also reviewed.From the single-location measurements of the early years, instrumentation has progressed to imaging initially in two dimensions (topography) and then three (tomography). The methods of analysis have also changed tremendously, from the simple modified Beer-Lambert law to sophisticated image reconstruction and data analysis methods used today. Due to these advances, fNIRI has become a modality that is widely used in neuroscience research and several manufacturers provide commercial instrumentation. It seems likely that fNIRI will become a clinical tool in the foreseeable future, which will enable diagnosis in single subjects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Motion artifacts are a significant source of noise in many functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiments. Despite this, there is no well-established method for their removal. Instead, functional trials of fNIRS data containing a motion artifact are often rejected completely. However, in most experimental circumstances the number of trials is limited, and multiple motion artifacts are common, particularly in challenging populations. Many methods have been proposed recently to correct for motion artifacts, including principle component analysis, spline interpolation, Kalman filtering, wavelet filtering and correlation-based signal improvement. The performance of different techniques has been often compared in simulations, but only rarely has it been assessed on real functional data. Here, we compare the performance of these motion correction techniques on real functional data acquired during a cognitive task, which required the participant to speak aloud, leading to a low-frequency, low-amplitude motion artifact that is correlated with the hemodynamic response. To compare the efficacy of these methods, objective metrics related to the physiology of the hemodynamic response have been derived. Our results show that it is always better to correct for motion artifacts than reject trials, and that wavelet filtering is the most effective approach to correcting this type of artifact, reducing the area under the curve where the artifact is present in 93{\%} of the cases. Our results therefore support previous studies that have shown wavelet filtering to be the most promising and powerful technique for the correction of motion artifacts in fNIRS data. The analyses performed here can serve as a guide for others to objectively test the impact of different motion correction algorithms and therefore select the most appropriate for the analysis of their own fNIRS experiment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},
